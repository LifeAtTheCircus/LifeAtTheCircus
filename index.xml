      <description>This February the girls had their very first international meet in Orlando Florida!

And since the meet happened to be only 10 minutes from Universal Studios, we decided to add a day of Family Fun at Universal Studios before heading home from Florida.

Our oldest son has read the entire Harry Potter series more than once as well as some of the “bonus books” like Fantastical Beasts and Quidditch Through the Ages… child number two got into the Harry Potter phase this fall and is currently reading book 5.</description>

      <title>St Kitts: More Beach Fun and Monkeys!</title>

      <description>Our final port of call was St Kitts.
. 
We didn’t really have a game plan for St Kitts. All we knew was we wanted to find monkeys and a beach with some shells and snorkeling. We found a taxi driver who could take us to both!



After getting a chance to hold the monkeys, we set off for the beach.


Here we enjoyed several hours of sand, sun, swimming, sea shells, and snorkeling.</description>

      <description>When we found out the itinerary for the family cruise, Scott and I were super excited to see that the ship would be stopping at St Thomas… this meant that we could take an excursion to St John and visit US Virgin Island National Park!!!
That’s right, another vacation with a sign pic for the circus crew!!

National parks rarely disappoint and St. John was no exception. St John was our family’s favorite day of the vacation (and there were a lot of good days)!</description>

      <description>Our youngest daughter turned 10 during our vacation. It was the second year in a row that her birthday fell during our vacation. At first she wasn’t very excited about having to celebrate her birthday away from home….but turns out a Caribbean cruise isn’t too bad a place to celebrate ones birthday.
She has told me in the past that SOMEDAY, she would like to have an ice skating party. Um, Ice skating parties in July can be a tad tricky….</description>

      <description>Once we had our clothing situation resolved, a weight was lifted from our shoulders and were ready to show the kids the Caribbean. We were thankful we were able to get our errand running out of the way early and get the kids so we could hit the beach. We were off the ship for round 2 before 9 am!

We had decided ahead of time that our plan for Nassau was to walk to nearby Junkanoo Beach.</description>

      <description>The day before we left for vacation, I had commented to a friend that I found packing for our cruise to be more challenging than any other vacation because this was the first vacation we’d gone on where if we forgot something we couldn’t just run to Wal-mart to pick up what we needed…
Turns out I was worried for good reason, b/c when we arrived at the curb of the airport, we realized we had left behind one of our larger suitcases… the one with all of my and Scott’s underclothes and shorts and every day type clothing (it also had some decorations for our daughters 10th birthday that I was really excited about :-(.</description>

      <description>I LOVE hosting Christmas. And I am so thankful that my extended family allows me that privilege. I am thankful that they all have been willing and able to come year after year so we could share the day together. I don’t take it for granted. I know my parents won’t always be able to travel. I know my BIL and SIL can get stationed so far away that it just doesn’t make a trip to MD possible.</description>

      <description>About a month ago my youngest asked when we would see the Statue of Liberty again. We visited it a few years ago on our way to our Boston Vacation, and it has been a highlight memory of our youngest child ever since. He loves when we spot it on tv or in a picture somewhere. I replied, “Probably the next time we go to New York City.” To which he of course replied, “When can we go to New York City again?</description>

      <description>A quick search through old posts and you will discover that I am a complete sap about gap toothed smiles. In my humble opinion, they are beyond precious and absolutely adorable. So, when our youngest lost his first tooth this week, I was completely smitten.
It’s been loose for awhile, but unlike my other children he wasn’t eager to pull it. No light saber pulling, or tying the tooth the the door knob.</description>

      <description>We’ve been home two and a half weeks and I am finally taking time to record the moments of our last day of vacation…. this is proof positive that I am glad I took the time to record our memories while on vacation b/c there is no way I could have gone back and done it once home.
We woke up QUITE cold on our last full day of vacation at Great Basin National Park.</description>

      <description>We left Gana’s house around 11 on Saturday. Our destination was Great Basin National Park in eastern Nevada. Our route was ‘the loneliest highway in America’. It was by far our longest drive of the trip, 8 hours with no midpoint destinations. But, of course, we made a few stops. We were not expecting much. We had mentally interpreted “loneliest highway” as “boringest highway” and thought it was going to be 8 hours of unchanging desert.</description>

      <description>We can not make a trip to the state of California without finding a way to visit Scott’s Nana. Even though California is a big state, and being in California does not necessarily equate being in Nana’s neighborhood. Compared to the east coast, anywhere in California is MUCH, MUCH closer to Nana’s than normal. So, we knew our trip to California, MUST include a visit at Nana’s (or as the kids call her Gana for G reat N ana ).</description>

      <description>I love big cities. D.C., New York City, Boston, Chicago, Seattle, Philadelphia… So, it probably doesn’t surprise anyone, Scott included, that when I was plotting our road trip from Pinnacles NP to his Nana’s north of Sacramento, I insisted we “swing by San Francisco” for lunch on our way. It was an hour drive out of the way (plus whatever time we spent in the city) but I really, really wanted to do it.</description>

      <description>During our trek across California, we wanted to also make time to see some of Scott’s family that live here. Scott’s aunt, uncle, and his cousin and her family live a few hours from Pinnacles National Park and graciously offered to meet us there and spend time with us at the park.

We met at a restaurant called Togo’s… we had never heard of it before, but Scott’s cousin described it as “like subway only better.</description>

      <description>Scott had been hoping for us to take a hike down from Glacier Point to Yosemite Valley. It would be our longest hike, but it would have been all down hill and we would pass both Nevada and Vernal Falls. Given our kids fascination with water falls, this seemed like a fun hike. Unfortunately, we learned too late that there was no shuttle from Yosemite Valley to Glacier Point, and the only way we could do this plan was if we had pre purchased tickets for a special shuttle that left early in the morning.</description>

      <description>Scott and I visited Yosemite 14 years ago during our trip which shaped all trips. Therefore, it wasn’t a must see for this vacation. And when Scott and I were first plotting out this trip, we kind of waivered as to whether we wanted to include it or not. But, we decided that since Yosemite is one of the quintessential parks and since we were were were going to be SO CLOSE, we owed it to the kids to show them Yosemite.</description>

      <description>Our campground was located pretty much on the border of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. We woke slowly and had a leisurely breakfast, then headed out to see Kings Canyon.

As we approached the visitor center, we saw a sign for a church service in the park. We were only 5 minutes late so we ran down to join them in worship. It was pretty neat to be able to join with other believers in worship, right there in the midst of God’s creation.</description>

      <description>We arrived at Sequoia National Park around 2:00. We had a picnic lunch, stopped by the Visitors Center and headed off to find some big trees.

We took a 4 mile hike in the late afternoon, that as of this point, goes down as my favorite hike of the trip. We started in the populous area of the infamous General Sherman.


Then we hiked the Congress Trail.</description>

      <description>After our morning at the beach, we were headed north west to prepare for the next leg of our trip. But before heading to 4 more National Parks, we were in need of hot showers, soft beds, and a washing machine.
Enter, Best Western.

We hadn’t booked a hotel in advance because we weren’t exactly sure how far we’d want to drive on Friday… we knew we wanted to get close to Sequoia National Park.</description>

      <description>Since marine life is part of Channel Islands National park, we woke up at 5:30am so we could visit some nearby tide pools while it was low tide.

 
The kids didn’t seem to mind too much though, because the promise of seeing “cool things” was all it took to get them up and at it. Even our late sleeper had a smile on his face.</description>

      <description>This trip seems to be all about extremes and remoteness. Channel Islands National Park is a group of islands located off the coast of Los Angeles. A visit here gives one a glimpse of what the California coast looked like before it was overpopulated with humanity. You can find vegetation and wild life here that doesn’t exist anywhere else. The signature element of the park however is the rocky cliffs along the waters edge and the marine life.</description>

      <description>After leaving Joshua Tree, we were headed west for the Pacific Ocean. We checked out the visitor center and checked in with the boat company about our day trip the following day. Then we stopped at Subway to grab subs for dinner on the beach. 
We were camping at a State Park which had walking access to the beach. We all greatly enjoyed eating dinner overlooking the ocean and than splashing in the waves afterwards.</description>

      <description>While we pack a lot into these trips, the over all plan is always pretty fluid. Scott and I had always left a second night at Joshua Tree as an option in our itinerary. After a great evening sunset, animal show, morning hike, and visit to the visitors center, the heat of the day had us thinking perhaps we should move on to cooler pastures. The kids however had so much fun climbing around Jumbo Rocks that they unanimously voted we stay the second night.</description>

      <description>Our campsite was at Jumbo Rocks, aptly named being as the campground was nestled amongst big rocks.
 
As with any desert park, the key to hiking is to go early or late. Right after breakfast we set off to hike the Skull Rocks trail. The trailhead was within walking distance of our campsite. Since we were hiking in the early morning, we came across a few animal friends along our way.</description>

      <description>We left the salt flats in Badwater Basin of Death Valley around 10:30am. After heading 45 minutes towards Joshua Tree we came across a road closure and had to turn around. This of course added about 2 hrs to our 4 and a half hour drive to Joshua Tree. I had found a restaurant online in Pioneertown that I had decided would be worth a little extra driving out of our way.</description>

      <description>Don’t get me wrong. Death Valley is aptly named. It is hot. Like crazy hot. Like 95 degrees at 7am, hot. And it is desolate. Like, LITERAL MIDDLE OF NOWHERE, desolate. Not a soul in site for miles and miles. And of course the signs everywhere warning you of heat stroke and death and the need for water. I get why they call it Death Valley. And quite a lot of the park looks like this.</description>

      <description>When we first began our quest, I assumed Death Valley National Park would be a mere checking off of a box. But, as we started planning and I began researching things to do there, I realized it really was a beautiful and unique park. 
Sunday morning we started out with a relaxing morning at our hotel near the airport in Vegas. We woke up, took showers and took advantage of the complimentary breakfast.</description>

      <description>After much saving and planning, the circus fam set off for another National Park adventure. Our mission: to visit 8 national parks (7 in California and 1 in Nevada).

Because we wanted to maximize our time at the parks, we opted to fly to Las Vegas and rent a van. We plan to camp for 12 of our 17 nights of vacation. The thing about camping is it requires the same amount of stuff for one night away as it does for 5 or 12.</description>

      <description>I love Washington D.C. And I love the Cherry Blossoms. And while we don’t make it in to see them every year, I do enjoy it when we can. When I heard they were going to peak during spring break, I told Scott I wanted to try and go in to see them. We had planned to go in last Monday but then the cooler weekend, slowed down the peak time.</description>

      <description>Over 2 and a half years ago our oldest son started BJJ. For several months I’d sit in the waiting room and watch his class or wait for his class. And during that time, I saw a women’s fitness class that took place… either during or before or after… at any rate, I’d get glimpses of the women working out in there. And when I first saw them I thought, “Oh my goodness… those ladies are insane.</description>

      <description>Some of my kids birthdays hit me harder than others. Each year I feel the passing of time in a way I never felt for myself. Each year I am washed with a wave of nostalgia and spend a good amount of time looking back at pictures of that precious child through the years. Each year I do my best to shower my child with love and attention and all of their favorites b/c we spend 364 days reiterating to our children that life is not all about them, and on their birthday it is mostly about them.</description>

      <description>Cut out sugar cookies are my kids favorite Christmas cookies. And I must confess that they are my favorite to make.

Because, the mess and the silliness, and the giggles, I love it!
 
 
I typically have them cut out the cookies one day and we decorate them another. This year we decorated them with our cousins.

More kids, more mess, more fun!</description>

      <description>We had a wonderful Thanksgiving in Pennsylvania with my family.

On the way home, we stopped at a new to us tree farm to cut down our tree.

 





It was an unseasonably warm day and we had a wonderful time finding our tree. Looking forward to the Christmas season!</description>

      <description>This weekend was our annual raking of the leaves, which is always followed by the annual Daddy tossing the kids high into the sky.

And truthfully when I saw our annual raking of the leaves…. I mean Scott’s annual raking. I occupied myself with indoor cleaning and only went out to snap some pictures of the fun at the end.
The kids LOVE when Daddy throws them high into the pile.</description>

      <description>Last week was a busy week at our house. Scott was on travel for three full days. The girls had a big meet at their gym. They had to score out of level 5 in order to be able to compete this year as level 6’s. Saturday the boys had a tournament. It was the first one for our 5 year old. Throw in the normal hustle and bustle of school and practices and scouts and you get the idea.</description>

      <description>We went on a field trip today to the Smithsonian’s Museum of Natural History. Man, I forgot how many cool exhibits it has. We haven’t been for several years. While we had seen some of these things before, it was so neat to see them again. And we added new things to our experience this time around.

We started the day by attending a class with some of our friends from our tutorial, which was led by some museum workers.</description>

      <description>This year we had another eclectic crew going door to door pedaling for candy. 
We had Big Ben Roethlisberger.

Cleopatra

Athena

and a knight…. who put together his own costume with the help of his older sister, Athena, all with supplies gathered in our costume bin.

Things I loved were the fact that the boys costumes cost me nothing, as they gathered the supplies from around our house… and the girls costumes can be used again this spring for our history night at school, since we are studying ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome this year.</description>

      <description>The look on my daughter’s face when I told her that I was able to change her dr appointment (again) so she could attend the fable festival for her writing class at our tutorial, was one I don’t want to forget.
It was one of those times when I didn’t realize how big of a deal it was to her. But, when I told her I was able to switch her appointment, her face lit up.</description>

      <description>Sometimes when Scott tells me he has to go on travel for work, part of me wishes I could just crawl in his suitcase and tag along. So when Scott came home and told me he was going to be traveling to Florida for a week and suggested that maybe we come, I was thrilled! I had to do some finagling with our schedule…. move an eye doctor appointment, get someone to trade meal train dates with me and brace the girls for the fact that they would need to miss a week of practice (this of course was met with GREAT weeping and gnashing of teeth, b/c these girls love gymnastics practice more than just about anything on earth)….</description>

      <description>Our tutorial was off on Monday and we decided to have Scott take off as well and have a family fun day. We toyed with the idea of camping trip, but instead opted to stay home and go on outings Sat, Sun, and Monday. It was a really nice weekend. We found a hike only an hour away. It was PERFECT!
We slept in, took care of a few things around the house and hit the road a little after 11.</description>

      <description>Since the Steelers don’t play until Monday night this week, and it was forecasted to be a beautiful afternoon, we declared today to be Pumpkin Day! Thanks to a trip to Trader Joe’s last night we had pumpkin cinnamon rolls for breakfast before church and pumpkin ravioli for lunch. (the cinnamon rolls were a bigger hit with the kiddos). Then we crossed the Bay Bridge for some pumpkin patch fun on the Eastern Shore.</description>

      <description>Our local fire station had an open house this morning and we took the kids.

I always appreciate the demo they do where they have a fireman get into his full uniform and mask so that the kids know in the even of a fire to go towards them, not hide away from them.
 


In addition to climbing on the trucks and sitting inside they had several educational experiences for them.</description>

      <description>Well, it’s pretty much official. I think I will pull out the fall décor this weekend and start lighting my beloved pumpkin spice candles. Summer has come and gone. But before I take my first sip of a Pumpkin Spice Latte (I always hold out for that one till the kids first day of their tutorial….), I do want to look back on our summer.
I did a lot of deep cleaning this summer and attempted to reign in the chaos and instill some order in the circus house.</description>

      <description>I think one of my favorite things about our annual Labor Day weekend away with our friends, is the fact that it has elevated Labor Day to the status of super special holiday. Prior to our tradition (14 years in the making) Labor Day was just a three day weekend at the end of the summer, or a reprieve as you adjust to the routine of school back in session. Because my kids have literally grown up celebrating Labor Day with a 3 day weekend away with friends that feel more like family, they assume Labor Day is right up there with Thanksgiving.</description>

      <description>Since going to training camp last year, my oldest has been scheming and planning exactly where he would stand to try and get Ben Roethlisberger’s autograph. My parents got him Ben’s jersey when he was a baby. Ben was our rookie quarterback when our son was a newborn and he has proudly worn his #7 jersey for the past 11 years. And more than anything, he wanted him to sign his jersey.</description>

      <description>Lest anyone think our life is some picture perfect world where everyone always gets along and the sun is always shining…
It isn’t.
We had some moments like this.

And truthfully our vacation didn’t start at all like I had planned. We were supposed to leave early on Friday and drive to Latrobe to see the Steelers Friday Night Lights practice. One practice per training camp the Steelers play a scrimmage practice under the lights at the local high school.</description>

      <description>We woke up Monday morning and one of the kids asked, “What the plan for today?”
Our response: “Nothing”
We figured we’d end up at the pool at some point that day but other than that, we had nothing on our agenda. Some of the kids were better at self entertaining than others, but they all ended up enjoying themselves. We ended up with a fabulous camp site. We were close to the bathrooms and the water spicket.</description>

      <description>Most of the time we use camping as a cheap way sleep on vacations. We have the goal of visiting every National Park and the way we approach it is by spending pretty much every ounce of our time exploring the park. Most days we usually end watching a sunset, and often the best spot for viewing the sunset is not from our campsite, which gets us to our camp site in time to set up camp in the dark.</description>

The weather was perfect. Low humidity, blue skies, and temps in the 80’s. It was perfection!

I can’t really even put into words what a joy it was to watch the kids play with their cousins.</description>

      <description>Because our kids all left for one place or another on Father’s Day, we decided to celebrate the week after. I had originally planned a low key afternoon followed by a family picnic at a park for the evening. But, Saturday ended up being an incredibly LONG day…. 8 hours total of driving in the rain to pick up our campers and bring them home, plus a soggy basement to sop up once we got home….</description>

      <description>The same week our daughter went to gymnastics camp, our oldest son went to his first week away at camp with the Boy Scouts. I have to say I am so impressed with the Boy Scouts. Our son has learned so many valuable life skills through his years in Cub Scouts and his months as a Boy Scout. And I am super thankful for the troop he is in. There is a great group of guys there, both in his age group, and in the older guys.</description>

      <description>Every year the majority of the girls at our gym attend gymnastics camp together in Pa. In fact, even some of our coaches go. Our oldest daughter has been wanting to go for years. Last year anytime I would say, “Guess what?” or “I have a surprise for you,” she would always respond with, “I get to go to camp?” Seriously, every little guess what and surprise suddenly seemed like a let down.</description>

When I was prepping goody bags earlier in the week, my 9 year old came up with a suggestion for the party. She suggested I make bamboo sticks by dipping pretzel sticks in green chocolate. I loved the fact that she wanted to contribute to the party and was eager to celebrate her creativity. So, I went to the store and got the supplies for her bamboo sticks.</description>

He literally started counting down the days about 5 days out. “Then it became after this day after that day is my birthday.” The day before his birthday he told me he wanted to fall asleep early so his birthday would come sooner. We kissed him goodnight for the last time as a 4 year old and sent him up to bed.</description>

Sooooooooo an overnight camping trip was planned to make both wishes come true.
The look of excitement when he told her his plan was priceless. And I loved watching her pack her stuff for their night away.</description>

However, the one local tradition I fully stand behind is the Blue Angels show every May. Growing up I only recall watching it from the field of our high school, as they soared overhead.</description>

      <description>This past week was insane. We had our year end celebration night at the tutorial on Thursday. This is the night when they proudly display their science and history projects, as well as present the recitations they’ve been memorizing all year. This meant that Tuesday and Wednesday were spent feverishly working on completing those projects. Throw in 2 trips to the pharmacy for strep throat medicine, practices, May the 4th celebrations, and Scott working overtime… and you result in one messy house….</description>

      <description>The other night I was speaking with my child about her words. What was of particular concern to me was the way she said things. I told her she needed to apologize for something and she said “sorry” in that voice that didn’t sound at all like she was sorry. I told her she didn’t sound sorry. I told her that she needs to be mindful not just of what she says but HOW she says it.</description>

This week my son turned 11. I already wrote about his party earlier, but I just can’t stop reflecting on it.</description>

      <description>Today we celebrated my oldest son’s 11th birthday.
How is it that I have been a mom for 11 years now? I have no idea…. but today isn’t about me. It is all about him.
 He wanted a nerf gun party. I was so thankful for picture perfect weather on party day. It was a ton of fun to watch them all racing around the yard shooting each other.</description>

      <description>The kids and I spend a good amount of time in the van. And sometime last year I felt like maybe I was gonna pull my hair out as we fought over everything from whose turn it was to ride in the middle row, to whether or not we wanted the air blowing from the vents or not. Someone would inevitably kick someones seat, someone else would break out into an annoying song and before long ALL of us were grumbling and complaining.</description>

      <description>It was 3 years ago this month that we accidentally stumbled across our house.
And we fell in love with it.
There are many things I appreciate about our house, but it was the backyard that captured my heart. And truthfully still holds my heart 3 years later. When Scott looks back there, he often is just overwhelmed with the work that needs to be done…. but I guess since those chores don’t typically fall on my plate, I honestly never see them.</description>

      <description>Our oldest son has been a Cub Scout since first grade. I remember attending his first Blue and Gold banquet that year and watching the Webelos 2 crossing over and thinking, “Wow, those boys look so big.”
Then I blinked…

And before I knew it my boy was one of the big boys crossing over.

Not sure how that happened so fast.




He was blessed with two amazing den leaders.</description>

      <description>We’ve been wishing for a snow that would cover the grass blades and last night we got just that… a little over 4 inches of powdery snow fell last night and Daddy took an extended lunch break to go sledding with us and enjoy it while we could.

 
These two were my dare devils, trying to come up with whatever creative way they could to get the two of them down the hill the fastest.</description>

      <description>The kids and I escaped down to VA for just shy of 24 hours to spend some time with my SIL and her family. I adore Scott’s sister so a visit to her house was a bright spot in our week. We arrived in the early afternoon with time for me to take the 4 boys to the park while Aunt Karen took the girls to run a few errands.</description>

      <description>It’s hard to believe that my youngest will be school age next year. Seriously, how did that happen? Sometimes when we drop the big kids off at their tutorial on “school at the building days” he will pause outside the Kindergarten room and tell me, “That’s where I go next year Momma and then you will be all alone and so sad.” And my heart kinda breaks a little. Because he is right.</description>

      <description>It really has been fun watching our youngest play soccer this fall. And he truly has been so excited to have a sport of his own to go to for practices and games. He’s lived up having his turn with the celebration plate. And besides the first game (in which he was very cold and a little under weather), pretty much every other game he has looked like this
 Smiley and happy….</description>

      <description>What a Night!

We had a super fun Halloween evening this year and I am thankful we got to know several of our neighbors better. This year we had
Harry Potter 
Super Girl (yes she has been Supergirl for 1/3 of our Halloween’s but what can I say, the girl likes being super girl) This year she changed it up and went with pink super girl though.</description>

      <description>We carved our pumpkins tonight….


My second born has always been my tactile child. She loves getting her hands messy… she’s the one who loves the feel of dirt on her skin and apparently is also fond of pumpkin guts on her fingers. She happily squished and sorted seeds.

Her sister was less thrilled with the feel of pumpkin guts on her hands.

But,we were all happy with how the jack-o-lanterns turned out.</description>

      <description>While picnicking at the orchard last weekend, a bee made his way to our 4 year olds apple. As it buzzed around and lingered around his hands, Scott thought that it might freak him out so he started to swat it away.
“No Daddy!” our 4 year old protested, “he’s trying to become my friend!”

That’s one we hadn’t heard before…</description>

      <description>I absolutely love apple picking with my kiddos. 
This year I found a great price on delicious locally grown honey crisp apples at the local grocery store and we enjoyed them all fall and I was so tempted to skip out on apple picking b/c we had already enjoyed such delicious apples this fall. But apple picking is about so much more than the apples for me.
It’s the memories.</description>

      <description>It’s been a few years since we have been to the zoo, and our youngest has been eager to go and see real animals up close. He was super excited about the lions and tigers. He’s been asking for several months if we could go to the zoo. I thought fall would be a nice time as it wouldn’t be too hot. I was hopeful we could see animals being more active than in the summer months that we typically visit.</description>

      <description>I feel like we are off to a pretty good start this school year and we are settling into a routine.
The hardest part for me about home schooling and the part I like the LEAST is the juggling act of wearing both the hat of mom and the hat of teacher. The kids don’t understand that my making them do a subject they don’t like doesn’t make me a mean mom, it makes me their teacher.</description>

      <description>And so a new year begins… this morning was our first day back at the tutorial. I can’t believe it marks our 6th year of homeschooling. What a blessing this community had been to our family. Here we are starting 2nd, 3rd, and 5th grades!

“And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ—to the glory and praise of God.</description>

      <description>Our youngest child had his first soccer practice this week. 
As I struggled to put him into his shin guards and knee socks and cleats, all while watching him grin from ear to ear, my mind drifted back to going through this same right of passage with his older siblings….
Fall 2009


Fall 2010


Spring 2011


Gosh…. look at all those chubby cheeks and teeny tiny legs chasing after those soccer balls….</description>

      <description>I feel like the month of August is much like the 9th month of pregnancy. I go into crazy nesting mode as I gear up for another school year. There is the ordering of curriculum… then the purchasing of school supplies… then the organizing of the binders… and cracking open that homeschool cabinet which ALWAYS turns into the junk closet over the summer. Ya know, the “Company is coming and I need a place to hide all these papers and misc junk from the kitchen counters,” place….</description>

      <description>Ever since we signed our 4 year old up for soccer, he has asked when fall is… and my answer is always, “After Labor Day.”
So with Labor Day behind us, I guess I must officially bid farewell to summer.
If I am honest, summer break is one of my favorite parts of homeschooling… we work hard during the school year, but when our curriculum is done mid to late May, we play hard until fall.</description>

      <description>It’s hard enough not living in the home town of your favorite sports team. Even harder than that, is living in the town of the ARCH RIVAL of your favorite sports team. One way that I think we as a family have connected and stayed connected with our Steelers roots, is by making the trek to training camp as often as possible. We missed the last two years, but we went often enough over the past 10 years that the big 3 all remember going and talk about going and consider it a tradition.</description>

      <description>My daughter turned 7 last week. She wanted a gymnastics party with her friends. I had no idea how to throw a gymnastics party. Turns out if you invite 10 gymnasts over to your house, you don’t have to do anything to turn it into a gymnastics party. They do it themselves. We picked the girls up from practice and brought them to our house for the party. Minutes after walking in the door, they were on the bar downstairs, then the trampoline, then doing their routine in the back yard.</description>

      <description>1o years ago Scott and I went before our church and made a commitment before God to raise our son as a disciple of our Lord Jesus Chris. Father’s day weekend, 2004, we rejoiced with our congregation as he was baptized. This was not a sign of our sons salvation. It was the sign of God’s promise to save and cleans sinners who call upon Him. Our son was not saved, but we rejoiced in the seal representing God’s power to save.</description>

      <description>The last true day of our vacation (the day before we headed home) was in my opinion the most relaxing day of the week.
We slept in, ate breakfast, (the kids did the dishes), and then we headed out for a morning hike along the beach.
 
The tide was out and we discovered many living creatures in tide pools on the rocky beach
.


We made our way to the other side of the island and even caught a glimpse of the Boston skyline.</description>

Here the kids are in Boston.

      <description>After our rain delay/rain out, we finally made it to Peddocks Island… one day late. After hiking the LONG hike uphill to our site, I am so glad we didn’t attempt it during the torrential rainstorm.
It was a big enough hassle getting our stuff from the van to the ferry, off the ferry, on to the other ferry, off that ferry, and then up the long hike up hill to our site… but the weather was gorgeous.</description>

      <description>The plan for today was to wake up and prepare to catch a ferry to Boston Harbor Island to begin the camping portion of our vacation.
However, we woke to this.

And after checking the weather saw that the day was going to be off and on rain showers for the remainder. This seemed like less than an ideal setting to haul all our camping gear onto a ferry, off a ferry, onto another ferry, to our campsite AND THEN set up a tent… a tent with a screen roof none the less.</description>

      <description>We chose Boston for a family vacation destination this summer because of our study this past year on the American Revolution. However, I had no illusions of dragging four kids through the entire 2 and 1/2 mile freedom trail on a hot and humid summer day. We are actually going to spend the bulk of our week camping on an island in Boston Harbor, but I did want to show the kids a few highlights of history, especially my oldest as he is the history buff of the crew.</description>

      <description>It was super fun to take the kids to see the “Statue of the Liberty” on the first day of our vacation.

It was a cloudy and overcast day so the picture of the Manhattan skyline don’t pop with color, but it was still really neat to see the skyline from this vantage point.

At first we couldn’t figure out why our youngest would lay down on the ground when we were at the base of the pedestal.</description>

      <description>I love, LOVE picking fruit with the kiddos. Apple picking in the fall and strawberry picking in the spring are two of my favorite annual excursions with them. I was delighted when I found out that a family from our tutorial owns a pick your own blueberry patch. The younger three and I went Monday morning while my oldest was a day camp with the cub scouts. 
I hope to go back with all four of them and really stock up on some berries.</description>

      <description>Exactly one month ago today we had a Superman birthday party for my youngest. In addition to a slew of crepe paper, we hung a giant poster of Superman on the hutch in our dining room.
Last night I noticed that Superman still hangs in my dining room.

He’s hung there for an entire month.
We let him hang there until we moved it up to the boys room. This way it wouldn’t wrinkle or rip until we got around to it, and maybe by leaving it hanging in our dining room we’d be more motivated to get around to it sooner than later.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, the kids spent a long weekend at my parents while Scott and I enjoyed St Louis. While they were there, my parents took the kids to a friends farm. The kids had a blast. Seriously, a day doesn’t go by that they don’t mention the horses or the chickens or the barn cats. They even got to ride on the horses. Right up there with all those memory making experiences, was another new life experience for my 4 year old.</description>

      <description>They saying becoming a parent changes you. It does. Truly, nothing can prepare you for it. I remember so well the day our first born child entered the world. I remember all the nerves and excitement. One of the things that surprised me the most about becoming a mom was how much I fell even more in love with Scott on that day. I already loved him to pieces. He was already all I could have wanted and more in a husband.</description>

      <description>It seems to be that when you have more than one child… their differences sometimes seem to shine out, and they can kind of fall into different roles. The peacemaker, the organizer…. not that I am advocating type casting your children or anything. I know they can all play different roles at different times.
However, when I asked the kids to pose for a picture at the strawberry patch the other day, my youngest displayed his true colors…</description>

      <description>Scott and I started dating our senior year of high school, when we were both 17. A few years ago we were out for an anniversary date and realized that we were approaching the point in our life when we would have been together as much of our life as we weren’t together. We decided we wanted to celebrate such a momentous occasion and so we (and by we, I really mean Scott) calculated out when exactly that would be… our dates are different since we don’t share the same birthday.</description>

      <description>We recently celebrated my youngest sons birthday. Because he shares his birthday with our anniversary, we often celebrate his birthday over Memorial Day weekend… So, in his book he is 4 now though technically there are still a few more days till that occurs officially. I love this age… 3/4&amp;hellip; I love how his personality is developing as well as his sense of humor. I love how his vocabulary is growing and he tries out new words, many big words and he misuses them.</description>

      <description>Gah! It seems MORE than a month has gone by since I last updated the ol’ blog. What a time it was too. The whirlwind of the end of the school year. Last week we had our last day at the tutorial followed by their year end assembly. Wahoo!!! All those snow days we kept our nose to the grind stone are paying off now baby! I was so proud as I watched them get up front and recite all of the things they had memorized.</description>

      <description>Last week was spring break at the circus. It was an action packed week full of family fun. We played lots and lots of games, rode bikes, and the trampoline was pretty much in use non stop. We had Aunt Karen and the boys here from Sun night till Tuesday.  
Wednesday we went to Philly and Thursday night my parents and my nieces and nephew came to town till Easter.</description>

      <description>This year in History we are studying American History from the explorers to the war on 1812. I love history. It is my favorite part of home schooling. And I am so grateful that we live within driving distance of so many great historical sites. I really wanted to take the kids to Philadelphia for a day trip over spring break. Scott graciously rearranged his work schedule so that he could join us.</description>

      <description>This weekend marked the end of the gymnastics season for my girls. They both finished the season strong scoring personal bests on more than one event. After the meet I ran into the grocery store to buy some brownie mix to celebrate and I was literally beaming from ear to ear. I felt like I wanted to tell everyone I saw about my girls success. I restrained myself though.
However, I do want to record my emotions and thoughts on here to look back on later.</description>

      <description>Spring weather arrived this weekend. We literally spent the entire day outside on Sunday (other than the time we were in Sunday School and church). It was wonderfully refreshing. A friend from church passed down a toddler bike with training wheels. My littlest guy was so excited to ride a big kid bike. 
I was impressed with how quickly he caught on to peddling. After two trips around the court, he could start himself, steer, and even ring his bell while peddling.</description>

      <description>Every year when the circus comes to Baltimore, they do a special lunch with the elephants at the nearby Lexington Market. It’s a Baltimore tradition. And according to what I’ve read, Baltimore is the only city that hosts such an event annually. When I told the kids this, they said, “Well, at least Baltimore has one good thing about it.” Hahaha… these kids may have been born and raised in Maryland, but their blood runs black and gold….</description>

      <description>Yesterday the family celebrated our beloved pup’s 1st birthday. We gave her a giant bone at lunch and after dinner we all enjoyed some Wendy’s Jr Frosties…. seemed fitting. We even presented her with a new squeak toy.
 I have never been a dog person, though I have appreciated the canine members of our house. There is something about watching a pup patiently accept the rough love of a toddler that warms a Momma’s heart.</description>

      <description>This week I took my girls on a field trip with their classmates from our tutorial. We visited a Science Center run by the local school system. The kids learned how to observe the world around them and record those observations. They studied bugs and wild life found in our area as well as learned about camouflage and even played a game to reinforce the concept.
They got to use almost all of their senses.</description>

      <description>I read an article a few months back that really made me think. The gist of the article was “Moms, watch the way you talk about your body because your body image will shape your daughters body image .” There was more to it than that, but that was gist. It seemed like wise advice, so I tucked it away.
And man, I’ve had to practice it a few times and wow is it humbling.</description>

      <description>When we switched out history curriculum this year so that the whole family studies the same period of history (with varying level of work catered to their age level), one of the reasons I was MOST excited was that our field trips would be applicable to all. When our tutorial gave off for Presidents Day, I was eager to take advantage of the day free of book work to go on a field trip.</description>

      <description>Thanks to the snow fall cancelling our evening activities, we had time to bake and decorate some heart shaped cookies last night.

(it should be noted after my previous post on Red Lake 40… that these cookies were decorated with all natural food dye from Whole Foods)

The snow looked magical as we watched it fall outside our windows. I called the kids down from bed to watch it for a bit and then let them sleep with their blinds open so they could fall asleep watching it.</description>

      <description>…she is fierce.”
That William Shakespeare quote has always reminded me of my oldest daughter. She’s small in stature but strong in will and spirit.
She turned 8 this week. I am proud of the girl she’s growing up to be. She’s not much like me. So many of her strengths are my weaknesses.
She’s logical and practical. She tells things like it is and is a no nonsense kind of gal.</description>

      <description>It’s been over a year now since we removed Red Lake 40 from our children’s diets. Cutting a processed food from our family’s diet was not a natural move for us. However, it has made a HUGE, HUGE impact on our family life and since I decided to do it after reading a blog once, I thought perhaps I should document our experience in case it might help someone else. The summer of 2012 I noticed that one of my children was having outrageous I mean OUTRAGEOUS temper tantrums.</description>

      <description>Bet you can’t guess what movie we watched this weekend?

little boys dressed as super heroes truly melt my heart… especially this little boy… sitting at breakfast with his tussled hair and sheepish grin…
We had a family movie afternoon yesterday and watched The 1978 Original Superman with the big 3 while our three year old was napping. He woke up in time to catch the heroic finish and then fly around the basement with his cape blazing behind him while the theme music blasted from our stereo.</description>

      <description>My own paraphrase of a very busy 30 minute period of time here at the circus on our first day back at school at home, based on the &amp;ldquo;If you give a&amp;hellip;.&amp;rdquo; book series. There is no embellishment here. This is how it really went down at the circus house this morning.
If you give a mom a minute, she&amp;rsquo;ll sneak a peak at facebook.
And when she sneaks a peak at facebook, she&amp;rsquo;ll see one of her friends posted a crock pot recipe.</description>

      <description>It’s funny how our New Years Eve festivities have changed through the years. Scott and I have never been big party animals, but we did go to downtown Pittsburgh on Dec 31, 1999 to ring in the new millennium with a kiss on the Roberto Clemente bridge. For several years we would watch the fireworks in Annapolis at midnight.
Then we had kids.
And New Years became a stay at home night.</description>

10 years from now when you are wondering what in the world to get Mom for Christmas, I have an idea for you. So write it down and stick it away and remember it when your 19, 17, 16, and 13. All I want for Christmas, is you. It’s true… nothing wrapped under the tree could possible come close to time spent with you. So, if you really want to make my day, ask me if we can make sugar cookies together.</description>

      <description>We got our tree today!!! 
We started decorating the house yesterday, but it wasn’t quite right without the tree. I don’t think our three year old remembers the Christmas tree b/c after we cut it down and tied it to our van he asked, “Can we keep it in our yard as our Christmas tree?” He had no idea it would go in the house. And then when we added lights, he was beyond excited.</description>

      <description>The thing that we most fell in love with when we first saw our new house was the back yard. We loved, LOVED the big, private back yard.
Clearly, it was not the fall when we had our love at first sight experience.

We spent the entire day tackling that beloved backyard.

Thankfully, we also made time for a little fun in the leaves.

Leaves can provide a great back drop for some smiley pictures.</description>

      <description>As a mom, there are several roles I play in the lives of my children. One of my favorite roles is that of cheer leader. I truly enjoy watching them compete/perform in whatever activity they are involved in and cheering them on as they do so. Yes, that’s right. I am that Mom you hear above the crowd cheering and squealing. This fall my son began a new sport. After years of wanting to try martial arts, he started Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.</description>

      <description>This wasn’t the first time my oldest daughter played the part of Super Girl for Halloween. 4 years ago she had the same role.
2009

2013

She tells me that when she’s 11 she plans to be Super Girl again… guess we are on an every 4 year rotation with this role. </description>

      <description>She’s been wiggling that tooth for weeks now… hoping and hoping it was ready to pull. I could see the tip of the new one peeking through behind it so I figured it was time for it to come out.
Daddy always does the honors round here, so she sweetly begged Daddy to pull it this morning before leaving for work. 

Part way in Scott realized that maybe that tooth wasn’t as ready to come out as we thought.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago Scott and I attended the wedding of a friend of ours from high school. As we sat there watching, I had this rather startling realization. Weddings are different for me now than they used to be. I can remember going to wedding for friends when we were in college. As I rejoiced with our friends over the start of their life together, I also found myself taking note of things I’d like to do in my own wedding “someday.</description>

      <description>This afternoon after church we took the kids to the county’s Public Safety Expo. The Police and Fire Departments for the country put on an INCREDIBLE expo. It was both fun and educational.
I think going into it my oldest son was a little like, “big deal we are going to see fire trucks” while my 3 year old was all “WAHOO We are going to see Fire Trucks” but everyone was surprised by all we got to see and do.</description>

      <description>My kids have gotten the Minecraft bug. Started first with my oldest son. He shared the obsession with my 6 year old daughter… and then even my child who doesn’t really like to play games, joined in the fight against zombies. Yesterday they finally figured out how to do multi player, which means they can all play at the same time on various different wireless devices in the same world. Giggles could be heard as they found each other walking around in their worlds.</description>

      <description>My dad called me last week and said he had 3 tickets to the Steelers/Ravens game if we wanted to come join him. His boss had generously given his tickets to my Dad and my parents generously offered to share them with us. I quickly called Scott who said, “Yes, we’ll make it work.” And make it work we did.
Our weekend was already jam packed with commitments so the only way to make it back was to drive from Annapolis to Pittsburgh and back in one day.</description>

      <description>This weekend was full of hayrides and pumpkins. Friday afternoon we went with some families from our 1st graders class to a pumpkin patch. 
It was beautiful. Hay rides are so fun. I am a sucker for them. How can you not have fun riding around on the back of a tractor looking at sunflowers and pumpkins?

My youngest child particularly enjoyed the hay ride and seeing some chickens and goats.</description>

      <description>I love the age of 3. I really feel like the personality of your child fully starts to emerge at 3. And 3 year olds are funny. I love their sense of humor and logic and cute little mispronounciations. And they start to pretend. 3 is really fabulous in my humble opinion and I am most def going to mourn the passage of time when I no longer have a 3 year old in the house.</description>

      <description>I love the ever changing smiles on my kiddos faces as they lose teeth and then gain new/big teeth. Over the past month or so my 7 year old lost 3 teeth… the latest one to come out was last night. 
She’s starting to look older to me lately…</description>

      <description>I haven’t had time to really update the blog lately. In fact, I have found my days to be quite full now that we are in full swing with our school and extra curricular activities. Bursting at the seams full. But, I have whipped the camera out a few times, so I decided today to download them and at least try to preserve some memories of everyday life around here.</description>

      <description>Almost every fall, I enjoy taking the kids to the county fair. We’ve been going since my oldest was under a year old. This year my youngest was so super excited. He talked about it for months. “When are we going to go to the fair and see the animals?” We went on Friday morning for the preschool preview day. Then my parents and I returned on Saturday for the girls to perform a gymnastics demo.</description>

      <description>Because our homeschool tutorial meets on a Mon-Thurs schedule and the board doesn’t like to start the year on a partial week, we are THE LAST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD (or so it feels like) to start back to school. But, today we finally had our turn for the morning poses on the front step. 
Another school year is upon us. We had an EPIC summer. One for the record books… and I while I didn’t tackle every project on my summer to do list, we are starting the year off a little more organized than last year.</description>

      <description>Labor Day. What does it really mean anyway? I’m not fully sure of it’s tradition or reason for existing, but I do know it means a 3 day weekend at the end of the summer and so I’ve never really questioned it.
It wasn’t until the summer of 2002, that it took on a whole new meaning for me and my family. That was the year we went to my friends family cabin with 5 other couples and just hung out.</description>

      <description>It was a typical afternoon for me… rush the kids into the van, make a quick stop at Walgreens for cough drops and pictures… a quick glance at the clock tells me we should make it to practice in time as long as we don’t hit traffic.
And then…
the car just stops… it almost felt like I could feel it drop, the steering wheel locked and I did my best to coast and steer it to the side of the road… or the entrance of the bus circle at the high school.</description>

      <description>Last week my oldest son went to a week of Cub Scout Day Camp. This year he was a Webelos 1. I remember vividly his first year when he was but a wee Tiger Scout.  He loves Cub Scout camp. And who wouldn’t? 8 and a half hours outside each day, fishing, archery, BB guns, wood shop, specials, crafts…
Each parent is required to volunteer one day. Two years Scott served in this role, last year I went, but it was the last day of camp and I didn’t get to see as much of the action.</description>

      <description>All of my kids have enjoyed pushing the pretend mower along side their Daddy, but I do believe none of them have enjoyed it as much as our youngest. The look of absolute GLEE on his face when he hears Daddy say it’s time for him to go cut the grass is absolutely priceless. 
He even willingly will choose to stay behind with Dad to cut grass and meet the rest of us at the pool MISSING SOME SWIM TIME rather than miss the chance to cut the grass with his Dad.</description>

      <description>Seems all of my posts recently are animal related, but truthfully, that is Life At The Circus these days… it’s all about the animals. Holding them, taking them potty, fighting over them…

Hands down the youngest two are my biggest animal lovers. My oldest son has taken way more to the cat than he thought though, he was surprised by how snuggly the kitten is and loves to hold her (though he has taken to either wearing layers of shirts or sweaters b/c he is not a fan of the scratching).</description>

      <description>I couldn’t believe how many old clichés took on a whole new meaning and relevancy to Scott and I last night when we welcomed our cat into our family. When I responded to the ad on Craigs List, I asked if there were any female kittens still available. She replied, that I was the first to respond to her ad, and so I could have the pick of the liter if I wanted to stop by that evening and take a look.</description>

      <description>Since late last fall, our youngest daughter has been lobbying hard for a cat. She did a school project on one, she drew endless pictures of them, she wrote stories about them, she slept with her stuffed animal cat every night and my favorite was the note she wrote Scott listing all their fine attributes.
 
We waited it out awhile, trying to see if it was merely a passing phase or if it would stick.</description>

      <description>This weekend we celebrated our youngest daughter’s 6th birthday. Since her reoccurring theme of the year was all things feline, it came as no surprise to me when she requested we have a cat themed birthday party. Because she doesn’t like cake, she requested brownies with little plastic cats on each one. (For real, those were her exact words) I was more than happy to grant that simple request. (hands down easiest birthday cake I’ve done for one of my kids)</description>

      <description>Since the passing of our beloved dog Maggie, there has been a void in our home. I missed her immensely more than I ever anticipated. And while no dog could ever replace her or what she meant to our family, we felt it time to once again hear the pitter patter of doggie feet in the circus home. But, we needed to wait until we were home from our grand adventure before welcoming a new pup to the family.</description>

      <description>Yesterday afternoon the girls got their baby dolls and strollers and headed to the court to walk their babies. I don’t know what it was about that particular moment in time, but it struck a chord in this Momma’s heart and made me all sappy. 
As I watched them pushing their dolls and pretending they were walking to China… with a stop in Tennessee for some Chick-Fil-A, I found myself longing to take in the moment.</description>

      <description>The last stop on our grand adventure of 2013 was Grandma and Papa’s house. We arrived in the afternoon on the 4th of July… just in time for a cookout. The kids greatly enjoyed tractor rides with Papa, playing board games with Grandma and running the trains in the basement.

Then they requested a visit to “The Coolest Playground Ever.” As we trekked around the US over the past 3 weeks, Scott and I learned from the kids that the playground by which all playgrounds are judged against is the wooden one by Grandma and Papa’s.</description>

Scott and I visited Chicago last year for our anniversary and while I loved the city and would love to visit it again, we didn’t feel this was the trip to take the family into the city. Instead we planned a stop at Lego Discovery Center outside of the city.</description>

      <description>After leaving the Badlands, we were Eastward bound and on the homeward stretch. We planned lots of fun stops for this part of the journey, knowing it was the final stretch and wanting to change it up a bit and keep things fun and exciting.
Our first such stop was in Sioux Falls, SD. I found a hotel there that had a water slide and a splash pool. There was also a put put course in town.</description>

      <description>Well, I am really sad to say our trip is winding down. We visited the last National Park of our vacation and we can count the number of days left on our trip on one hand. The last park on this grand vacation was Badlands National Park in South Dakota. 
We hit the Badlands on a great day and a great time of day. The sun was low in the sky making the colors pop out.</description>

      <description>Saturday we left Mt Rushmore and drove 4.5 hours north to Theodore Roosevelt National Park in Medora, ND. A visit to this park meant an approximately 9 hour driving detour from what could have otherwise been a short hop from Mt. Rushmore to the SD Badlands. Sometimes a quest such as our forces your hand to take some pretty circuitous routes… we set off not exactly sure what the ND badlands had to offer that the SD badlands did not.</description>

      <description>11 years ago when Scott and I did our first National Park/Cross Country trip, we drove through Wind Caves National Park. We hadn’t yet begun our quest to see every National Park, so we actually just drove through the park and enjoyed the prairie dogs and buffalo. It was literally a stop on our way, not a destination in itself. This time, Scott and I wanted to see the park the right way and go on a cave tour.</description>

      <description>Between the long, late day at Black Falls of the Gunnison and the crazy hot and dirty hike at Great Sand Dunes, Scott and I found ourselves ready for a reprieve. So, we readjusted our schedule a bit and drove 3 hours to a hotel about an hour from Colorado Springs. There we chilled. I took the kids for a quick dip in the pool while Scott ran out to get us a pizza.</description>

      <description>We arrived at Great Sand Dunes National Park in the middle of the night so our first view of the dunes was when we opened up our tent the next morning. We thought for sure we wouldn’t be able to get a site since they were first come first serve and we were so very late. But once again we were blessed with a camp site in the park.</description>

      <description>We left Canyonlands mid day on Monday and got a hotel in Montrose, Co. We were greeted with a fabulous view of the snow topped Rocky Mts. Scott took the kids swimming while I did laundry. Then we splurged and went out for dinner at Applebees. It was a welcome change from fast food/Subway. The next day we hit Black Canyon of the Gunnison!

This was a hard park to fully comprehend.</description>

      <description>We arrived in Mesa Verde National Park a few hours before sunset. We had been hoping to catch the Twilight Tour of Cliff Palace but tickets are sold on a first come basis and, much like we expected, we weren&amp;rsquo;t the first to come. We opted for a sunset drive along the loop with some pretty overlooks and booked tours for the following morning. 
The sunset drive was really fascinating.</description>

      <description>How many times have you wished you could be in more than one place at a time? I know there’s been many a time that I’ve had that thought….
And Saturday, I had my wish. We were in four places at once.
The circus family stood in Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado at the same time.

We goofed around a bit and then the big kids got to strike their favorite pose in 4 states at once.</description>

      <description>11 years ago this month Scott and I visited The Grand Canyon. It was my first time seeing it and it took my breath away. Now, 31 parks later, it is still my favorite of all the National Parks. Many rank high on my list, but if you could only see one, I feel like this should be the one.

The day before we took the kids, I had a little fear, much like the fear I had before taking them to Disney World.</description>

      <description>The highlight of our day at the Grand Canyon for most of the members of our circus crew was a short hike they took into the canyon. 
We all started on the hike, but it was more than this “fraid’ of heights Momma” could handle. The plan was to go to the first tunnel and back, but after about 2 treks on the switchback, I was biting back tears and hating EVERY second of it.</description>

      <description>Thursday we spent the day at Petrified Forest National Park, located in the painted desert of Arizona.

Here the kids worked hard to earn their Junior Ranger badges. We spent quite a bit of time learning and researching in the visitors center. 
We also took a walk to look at the petrified wood. 
We then drove through the Painted Desert. It was beautiful to see all the layers of colored dirt deposited.</description>

      <description>The kids were so excited to finally get to go camping. Day 6 of our adventure and it was our first night setting up a tent. The kids LOVE the head flashlights I picked up before we left. 
Unfortunately, we discovered we neglected to pack the poles with our tent. So we had a family meeting round the picnic table. We had 3 options. 1. Go to Walmart, get a new tent and come back and set it up.</description>

      <description>Tuesday we left New Mexico and headed south west for Saguaro National Park in Tuscon, AZ.

We got to Saguaro National Park in time to explore a bit and then take in the parks beauty after the oppressive heat of the day was past. It really was perfect timing. We walked around a path near the visitors center which allowed us to see the cacti up close. 
The cacti were much bigger than we expected and we were delighted to find some in bloom.</description>

      <description>While planning our trip, I was searching for some sort of fun diversion for our long car ride day. I wanted something free, fun, and not out of the way.
Cadillac Ranch fit the bill perfectly. 
Cadillac Ranch is a wide open field on the side of route 40 with 10 old cadillacs stuck in the ground. People can come and spray paint on them. It’s a “changing art exhibit” as people are continually coming and adding to and changing it.</description>

      <description>Sunday was one of the few days of our trip that we spent entirely in the van. While we will be in the car for portions of almost every day of our trip, Sunday was a day when the event for the day was driving. For over 11 hours. We left Ft Smith, AR around 9:45AM5am CT, quickly entered into Oklahoma, drove the top portion of Texas, and arrived in Albuquerque, NM a little after 11:00pm MT.</description>

      <description>The first national park on this grand adventure was Hot Springs National Park in Hot Springs, AR.

It seems we are passing on the sign picture tradition… as everyone wanted a picture of the sign with their camera. The town of Hot Springs was built to capitalize on the hot springs of water coming out of the ground in that area.

      <description>Saturday we left Nashville and continued further west. Our goal for the day was to reach Ft Smith, AR (on the border of AR and OK) and to visit Hot Springs National Park in Hot Springs, AR. Mission Accomplished
We were in the car from about 9:45am to 11:30pm… with the exception of 3 hours in Hot Springs. No one seemed to mind though. They had video games, movies, books, coloring pages, and crafts to pass the time.</description>

      <description>We started on our grand adventure yesterday morning. We set off a little later than we had hoped due to some storm preparations we had to make in case the forecasted impending storms took out our power while we were gone.
Our plan for day one was to drive from Annapolis, MD to Nashville, TN. Our route took us through DC which was a fun start.

We left our house around 10:15 in the morning and pulled into Scott’s cousins in TN around 10:30pm.</description>

      <description>You know how sometimes a movie or book will portray how one decision or one event changed the momentum and current of the character’s entire life?
Well for Scott and I, that momentum shifting/life altering event was our vacation in 2002. Somehow or other we got to talking about cross country trips. And somehow an idea blossomed for a large out west vacation. We had a huge map of the US in our laundry room and we began plotting our course.</description>

      <description>A year ago today Scott and I dropped the kids off at a friends house and went to sign on the dotted line about 20 gazillion times. We left with keys to our new home!
Scott and I headed to the new place to enjoy some take out Chinese on the back deck as we celebrated the immense blessing of this new home. Then as is the case quite often for us… our busy lives resumed… Scott back to work… me to grab some stuff from our old house to bring to our new house for our camp out that night… then we met up at the gym for our daughter’s Mini Olympics performance and I think we might have had a little league baseball game in there too… we got home much later that evening…</description>

      <description>Our littlest man was so, so excited about his third birthday. I wish there was some way to truly capture his joy and eager anticipation. He talked about his party daily since his brothers birthday in April. He’d tell me the date of his birthday and that he was turning “free” and that he wanted a choo choo cake, and a choo choo balloon, and a present, and a party. Then after his Daddy had his birthday in late May and had to leave to go to a meeting on his birthday, he then would add that he wanted a meeting on his birthday too.</description>

      <description>We celebrated my Dad’s 60th Birthday this week with a party at Hershey park. Dad, Mom, their kids, and their 8 grandkids. 
We had a blast riding the rides, but truly the best part was being together as a family and enjoying watching relationships grow. 

When you’re the oldest cousin sometimes you have to do time in the kiddy rides. He was quite the sport… and was rewarded with roller coaster time in the evening.</description>

As we prepare to leap into summer… let’s take a quick peek back at day 1.

Look how much they’ve grown just physically this year! I can’t believe it’s our last day of Kindergarten, 1st grade, an 3rd grade.

They got to dress down for the last day of school. (Can you tell it’s been a chilly spring?</description>

How cute I thought and went to grab the camera.
My little man spotted me.
I went back to my chores and then noticed he had moved.
This time he was on the other side of the door and had set up a barricade with another box.</description>

      <description>When you have a baby people offer you all sorts of odd, unsolicited, terrifying, and often contradictory pieces of advice. One that I have heard over and over the past 9 years is “Don’t blink.”
And I have tried really hard not to.
I have tried really hard to savor the chaos. It’s a large part of the reason why I blog. I want to record the every day. The funny things they say, the crazy outfits they pick out, the battles we engage in, the toys they love… and yes, even the unending laundry pile, and the sink overflowing with dishes… Because I know what those who have gone before me have told me is true… the days are long, but the years are quick.</description>

Doom.

The kids pulled together some costumes… We have from left to right, Gimli, Frodo, Samwise Gamgee, and Aragorn.</description>

      <description>Since birth she’s always been trying to keep up with the older two. And most of the time, because she can hold her own with them, I think of her and treat her like she’s older than she really is. One night last week as we went in to peek on her before going to bed we saw her sleeping in her bed with her stuffed animals and dolls lying all around her… it was a little nest of sorts with her in the middle of her beloved toys.</description>

      <description>I remember when my son was in kindergarten he came home and told me he asked a girl in his class to marry him. “What did she say?” I responded. “No. So I told her,why don’t we wait till we are older to decide.” I cautioned him that should he ever want to propose again, he should talk to us first and then talk to the girls parents first.
I remember this so vividly b/c I knew, I knew there would come a day when he would balk at such a discussion.</description>

      <description>After a week of fun, friends, field trips, house work, sleeping in, and even a camp fire, we’re topping off our Spring Break with a long weekend at Grandma and Papa’s.
I have found that packing up the circus crew of 6 for even a weekend away, can at times be a bit overwhelming. And while the kids love to help pack, sometimes they are anything but helpful. So, I found a system that works pretty well for us.</description>

      <description>I don’t really know what it is that possesses a child to just randomly on a whim pick up that crayon and suddenly decide to make the world (or in this case the bathroom) his canvas. We have crayons out every single day in our house. I do my best when I see a stray one on the floor to nab it lest it suddenly look inviting to my toddler. But, truly they are laying on the school table, in reach, every single day.</description>

      <description>Last weekend was our Cub Scout Pack’s Pine Wood Derby race. It is one of the favorite Cub Scout traditions. Scott and our oldest son worked hard on the car.

My son had one focus: speed
He wanted his car to be as fast as possible. Whenever they discussed designs or modifications, speed was always his deciding factor. 


He designed his car to look like Bullet Bill from Wii Mario Kart.</description>

      <description>Scott has been a huge help and support to me this week… taking time off of work so I can rest up (apparently surgery takes more out of you, then you anticipate)… driving the kids to their activities, helping with school, and meals and cleaning up… So, today, I thought I’d show my appreciation and wear my “My Husband Rocks” tee shirt. My 7 year old looked at my shirt, read it aloud and said, “So, why did you wear that today?</description>

      <description>I had to have surgery this week to remove a skin cancer spot on my nose. Having gone through skin cancer a few other times, I naively thought it was going to be no big deal. So, I went into the surgery center very low key. I couldn’t believe how many people were in the waiting room when I arrived for my 7:45 AM appointment, but since I was the youngest one there by a good 40 years or so, I am guessing this is normal.</description>

      <description>So it was one of _ those _ library trips where I was really regretting going. We were pushing close to past bed time and Momma was tired. But, I knew there were some books on the hold shelf waiting for me and I had two bags of books in the van to return, so I figured we’d run in “real quick.” But, of course, it wasn’t real quick. I had to help my Kindergartner find a book on cats for her science book.</description>

      <description>This afternoon I was finishing up in the shower, when my youngest walked into the bathroom. I told him, “Hold on bud, Momma’ just needs a minute. Can you give me some privacy?”
His response?
No Mommy. I can’t. I can’t find your pivacy. Neither can I…. going on 9 years now since I lost it.</description>

      <description>So, it turns out we have a sneak here at the circus.
Yes, behind this adorable smile is actually a rather devious little chocolate hoarder. Earlier this week the kids received a package of chocolate from their cousins for Valentines day. I let them all have one after lunch and then we put the box up on the counter for later. Later that evening when the kids wanted another piece after dinner the box was no where to be found.</description>

      <description>The other night I came up to kiss the girls goodnight and found them voluntarily cleaning their room. And folks,I don’t mean stuffing toys under their beds and clothes down the laundry shoot. I found them in the closet sorting and they asked me for a laundry basket and a trashcan. It was already past their bed time, but they were clearly in the cleaning mode. And I know when it comes to things like Deep Cleaning you gotta embrace the mood when it hits.</description>

      <description>When we walked through the house with the kids, after we knew we had won the contract, they eagerly checked out their bed rooms to call dibs on which would be the boys room and which would be the girls room. The boys chose one of the 2 “kids rooms” and the girls petitioned for the master bed room. After all they pointed out, “it has a bathroom right off of it and we go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, not you guys” and “it has the laundry shoot in their too so we’d be sure to put away all our dirty clothes” and it had plenty of room for their bunk bed and dressers.</description>

      <description>It’s February and that means Blue and Gold banquet season for Cub Scout folks. An annual tradition at our Blue and Gold banquet is the Dad/Lad cake decorating contest. [
](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_9501.jpg)

This is always a fun event in the circus household. Even though all of the baking and decorating is done by Dad and the cub scout… the rest of the kids greatly enjoy observing the fun in the kitchen.</description>

      <description>A State of the Union here at the Circus Casa on this Friday afternoon would include a sink overflowing with dirty dishes, a living room with traces of party balloons and presents strewn about, a dining room bursting with hearts and red and a pile at the bottom of the laundry shoot at near epic proportions.
It’s been a full week at the circus. Started the week off celebrating my daughters 7th birthday… she had a party, a gymnastics meet, and grandparents and cousins in town for the occasion.</description>

      <description>I recall seeing something on Facebook before I went to bed about possible flash freezing or snow. But, I didn’t give it much thought.
When I woke up I peeked behind the curtain to see if anything came of it and I gasped. It was that big white puffy snow that sticks to the branches of trees. My most favorite kind of snowfall. And I laid in bed and watched it fall snuggling with my hubby and kids.</description>

      <description>I’ve got pictures of all of my kids as babies snuggling up with our beloved dog… I’ve got the classic shots of them getting a big wet slobbery kiss while they giggle with glee. And Maggie lovingly observing their tummy time activities.
But, of my four children, my youngest is by far the most captivated by our dog. 
He truly loves her. He excitedly greets her when we come home.</description>

      <description>The youngest circus member is 2 and a half now. (HOW CAN THAT BE?) And I have to tell you he makes me laugh. EVERY.SINGLE.DAY with the cute little things he says, the WAY he says them and those precious little facial expressions. He totally has my heart. 
He still LOVES choo-choos. Plays with them every day. He has also recently started enjoying Sesame Street…particularly Elmo (who he affectionately calls Emo) (like Nemo only no N) He loves to run around the circle on our main level… many, many times a day he will run laps around that circle then come to me and say “faster and faster?</description>

      <description>I am a words person. Always have been. I love cards, and notes, texts and e-mails. And I save them. Yup… every note Scott ever passed me in high school, every birthday card, Valentine card, anniversary card… I have them all in a box.
So, it should come as no surprise, that when my kids start writing, I started hoarding those precious words as well. I know can’t save them all, but I do try to save the “significant ones”.</description>

      <description>Our 6 year old had her first gymnastics meet this past weekend. I can’t really put into words the feelings of pride I had in watching her. When we first enrolled her in gymnastics 3 years ago, we did so because she was tiny, tough and flexible. It seemed gymnastics might be worth a try for our then 3 year old.
Somewhere in the last 3 years, a light when on inside her.</description>

      <description>It’s always fun to peek in on my kiddos when they are sleeping. Sometimes because it gives me a good chuckle, sometimes because it tugs at my heart strings, and sometimes just because it sets my mind at ease to see them sleeping snuggly in their rooms. Last night as I was crawling into bed, I realized I hadn’t peeked in on them. I don’t know if I’m the only Mom out there like this, but when I realize I forgot, I just can’t shake it off… I have to go b/c sometimes this little quirky fear will rise up “What if the one night I didn’t check on them something was wrong?</description>

      <description>It was our first time trick or treating in the new neighborhood and I gotta say it felt weird this year not doing it with our neighbor like we’ve done for the past several years. It wasn’t the same.
Still we had a good time dressing up as our favorite characters and chowing down on candy bar after candy bar when we got home. We let the kids go all in and devour their loot when they got home… then we let that sugar coma set in while we vegged on the couch with a little Charlie Brown and the Great Pumpkin.</description>

      <description>Some days we wake up on “school at the building days” with clothes all lined up and ready the night before, I’ve gotten lunches packed complete with notes from Mom, and we’re out the door on time so we can arrive at the building with plenty of time to drop everyone&amp;rsquo;s books off in their classrooms and report to the sanctuary for opening with time to spare.
And some mornings Mom oversleeps when her alarm goes off, laundry isn’t put away so we find ourselves scrounging through baskets of laundry looking for matching socks, lunches are packed but without drinks b/c we couldn’t find water bottles, and we stumble out the door racing the clock, with bed head and arrive at school only to discover the socks were left on the kitchen counter so we’re going in with just sneakers and no cute knee socks…</description>

      <description>I was scrolling around on pinterest one night and a graphic caught my eye that made me stop in my tracks. It showed 2 sides of the brains and listed descriptions for left/brain right brain people. 
I think often people are largely a little bit of both. However, when I looked at this graphic, it was like a portrait of my daughters.
I swear my 6 year old could be the poster child for the left brained person.</description>

      <description>I like to think of myself as a woman who can hold her own. I’m not a girly girl. I can follow a football game and I am currently 3-0 in my fantasy league. I love camping. Power outages don’t send me packing for the nearest Hilton. And I will happily kill and remove any bug that comes my way without even a squeal.
However, this “tough girl” fantasy that I have of myself falls apart rather quickly when confronted with my own personal kryptonite.</description>

      <description>We are three weeks in to our new school year. I think I FINALLY have all the kids correct curriculum (missed a few things I when I ordered it this summer) and their books organized in a way that works for them, me, and their tutors at the tutorial. I’ve done things a little differently this year, and SO FAR, it has helped our days to run more smoothly. First of all, I’ve committed to waking up before the kids every day.</description>

      <description>Lately, I’ve been asked several times what I do with my 2 year old while I am teaching the older 3. Here’s your answer. 
Yes, that would be pen mark up and down the corner of the walls in my dining room. Yes, he did that yesterday morning while I was working with the big kids in the other room and thought that scraping sound was the sound of him scraping oatmeal of his cereal bowl with a spoon.</description>

      <description>There are lots of things that I truly appreciate about our new house. Among the top is the location. This came as a surprise to many of our friends, because at first glance the location seems less than ideal. A large majority of our life is centered 20-25 minutes away from our house… our church, our tutorial, gymnastics, and many of our friends. However, one of the most important and integral parts of our family life is located a mere 2 miles away.</description>

      <description>The morning was going well… kids on time for tutorial, load of laundry in the washer and dryer, even took the van to the garage for some repairs.
And then, because things can’t go THAT smoothly….. 
 Yea… turns out even the otterbox can’t protect your phone when it’s been thrown off the side of a van and run over on the side of a highway. And, no, this had NOTHING to do with the new iphone 5 coming out today.</description>

      <description>Scott commented the other day that he feels the passage of time more noticeably at the beginning of the school year, rather than on the kids birthdays. I think he’s right.

Especially this year, when I packed up three backpacks and three lunch boxes and lined up 3 kids for pictures at the front door. We have our Kindergartener, on her very first day of school ever. 
Followed by our first grader.</description>

      <description>Just one day over 2 weeks from shipping her off to the doll hospital, Kit arrived on our door step during lunch today.

Her arm has been reattached and they even sent her home in a pretty hospital gown, with new socks, and her hair pulled up in a bow. 


It just so happened that Daddy popped home for lunch today and she eagerly greeting him on the steps to tell him the good news.</description>

      <description>When I started home schooling 4 years ago, I stepped back from most of my other responsibilities. I wanted time to figure out the ropes of homeschooling in addition to taking care of my family. But last spring, I started to feel a tug. I was ready to serve again. I wasn’t sure where or how, but I knew I wanted to serve in some capacity. (Keep in mind this is not because after 3 years of homeschooling I suddenly had the homeschool thing mastered… truthfully this year more than ever I feel more nervous about our school year….</description>

      <description>This weekend marked an anniversary of a life changing event in my life. In fact, one could say that my life is very, very different as a result of it.
2 years ago while on our annual Labor Day cabin trip I did something I had never done before. I finished a cup of coffee.
Sure, I had had a sip once or twice, hoping to like it like my friends… but I never really cared for it.</description>

      <description>I have friends that are super awesome yard salers. They get up at the butt crack of dawn on Saturday morning and drive all over the county finding great deals. They truly impress me and sometimes I think I want to be them, b/c I too like getting good deals.
But, I don’t like getting up at the butt crack of dawn any day of the week, much less Saturday. And I especially don’t like dragging 4 kids around with me all over the county at the butt crack of dawn, worse yet having the kids see stuff that other people are clearing out of their house and begging me if they can then bring it in mine and then me coming home without the outdoor patio table and chairs I’d been wanting but with a bag full of happy meal toys that are now going to clutter up our family room floor.</description>

      <description>We’ve had stitches, numerous trips to Right Time Care and even an over night hospital stay, but so far we haven’t had any broken limbs.
Until this week.
I was upstairs when I heard the blood curdling screams and sobs of my 5 year old. I raced downstairs to see her sobbing and holding her beloved Kit in one hand and Kit’s arm in the other. (I had noticed the day before, that her arm seemed wobbly and something wasn’t right, so it wasn’t a total shock to me).</description>

      <description>I’ve written time and time again of my hot/cold, love/hate, on again/off again relationship with the library. Despite the fines (and my husband can attest to the fact that we have paid MANY), I keep going back again and again….and the reasons are…

 1. the hush that falls over the circus van on the ride home as everyone is absorbed in their books (I’ve even been known to sit in the van in the parking lot soaking in that silence)</description>

      <description>My youngest was sitting on the floor “reading” his choo-choo book to our dog Maggie when I had to grab my camera and snap a picture. He then looks over at me and says, “Aww man, No SMILE!”
I said, “Ok, no smile.” and he happily went back to his reading.</description>

      <description>Number one sign you have a 2 year old boy in the house.
Nothing is safe. He will drag chairs to the counter to score out of reach cookies, he’ll fill cups with ice only to dump them on the floor, he’ll drink soda, coffee, whatever he finds left sitting out with reckless abandon. And he’ll sunscreen my dining room furniture. 
I had even seen the sunscreen lying out earlier and moved it to the center of the dining room table, “just incase”….</description>

      <description>Last night I fed my family a dinner so lacking in nutritional value or substance that it makes the time we had ice cream for dinner look healthy.
I kid you not.
We’ve been burning the candle at both ends round the circus parts the past week… finishing up projects at the old house, organizing the new house, having company, throwing a birthday party…having more company… somehow yesterday it ended up 8pm, the Olympics were on and we’d all been looking forward to watching them… we hadn’t eaten dinner.</description>

      <description>She’s my free spirit.
My morning girl.
My glass half full child. She loves to create… always drawing, writing letters or pictures, doodling on any paper she can find. She’s very verbal. When I put her in her room for quiet time, I often think someone has snuck in there with her b/c I hear her talking away—only to discover she’s talking to her self, or reciting things she heard on the radio or TV.</description>

The tooth fairy is pulling over time here at the circus… luckily, someone has forgotten to put his teeth under his pillow, so he’s cashing in tonight with all 3 he lost in the last 2 weeks… I love his new Jack-o-Lantern grin…however, I am not so keen on how grown up he’s looking these days. Though that seems to be a ongoing refrain round these parts. </description>

      <description>I’ve written before about the crazy places and positions I’ve found my kids sleeping in. It appears child number 4 is no exception to the random sleeping locations of the circus crew.
Last night, when I went upstairs for bed, I found him asleep in his door way like this.

Today at nap time, I again went up the stairs to find him out of his room. 
It appears he’s taken a preference for sleeping in the hallway/landing area of our home.</description>

      <description>His favorite thing these days is Choo Choos. He was so excited at Target the other day when we went down the Thomas aisle. “Choo Choo right there” he pointed excitedly, over and over. 
He always sleeps with at least one choo choo in his hand and is super thrilled with the choo choo mattress sheet his Grandma made for him. He also LOVES to wear his choo choo shirt, or bathing suit.</description>

      <description>Years ago Aunt Karen gave our oldest child a Life is Good soccer shirt. Because the color and theme were gender neutral, I ended up passing it down to my daughter a few years later. It actually became that perfect shirt for younger siblings to wear to soccer games so she could feel like she was a part of the team too. By the time my third child wore it, it was worn with shin guards and sometimes even cleats TO WATCH the older 2 practice.</description>

      <description>I love to read. I love when you get to that point in the novel, where you literally can not put it down and find yourself speed reading/skipping words just to quickly make it to the next part and find out what happens. One of our goals in educating our children was to make readers out of them. This was hard at first with our son as reading didn’t come naturally to him.</description>

      <description>One of the things I came across while packing for our move was a bottle of jewelry cleaner. As soon as I found it, I scrubbed my wedding rings. As I did, I realized it had been quite awhile since I had cleaned my rings. As I scrubbed, the grime became more and more apparent. I couldn’t believe how brilliantly they sparkled after I cleaned them. When Scott first came me my engagement ring, I couldn’t take my eyes off of it.</description>

      <description>The 4th of July kind of reminds me of Thanksgiving. I think the two go hand and hand really. Because as we celebrate the birth of our nation, our independence and our freedom, how can we not give thanks? We have so much that we’ve grown to believe we’re entitled to all of it and more. In the midst of a fun filled day of family and friends, of parades, and flags, burgers and hot dogs, fire works and red-white-and-blue, I want to pause a few minutes to reflect.</description>

      <description>Almost done catching up the journal blog on some of the big life happenings round here these past few weeks. Last, but certainly, not least, would be the girls Mini Olympics performances at gymnastics. I LOVE Mini-Olympic time. It’s the one time of year when we get to go on the other side of the glass wall and watch our girls up close. And since I am often entertaining a toddler or taxing around an 8 yr old or running errands, during their practice time, I truly cherish getting the opportunity to watch them perform.</description>

 camping out the first night in front of the fire place in an empty house riding bikes (every day since we got here… and I can’t believe how much better they are at riding bikes now… I have 3 proficient 2 wheelers now!</description>

      <description>These past few weeks have been some of the most exhausting in my life. It’s been 9 years and 4 kids since our last move and let’s just say we’ve acquired a whole lot more stuff since our last move. I purged and donated and purged some more and yet have found myself with enough miscellaneous boxes of random to sort through in the new house till Labor Day! Meanwhile we were listing our house for rent, showing it to perspective renters AND still trying to juggle the spring extra curriculars like year end home school evaluations, baseball games, gymnastics classes, play off games, mini Olympics, piano recitals, and birthdays and our anniversary.</description>

And we were giddy. As we lay on the floor in our bedroom looking up at the ceiling I remember Scott commenting on the ceiling fan. “Look at that ceiling fan! We own it!” I on the other hand couldn’t get my eyes of the red blinking light from the smoke detector…. wondering how would I fall asleep with it constantly blinking.</description>

Only, I didn’t just see this precious moment in time, but simultaneously, my mind flashed back to several other similar moments over the past 5 years….
September 2009

August 2008

And, April 2007

One can’t help but notice a few things when observing these father/child bonding moments in the back yard.
1. Believe it or not Scott, we’ve been VERY successful in growing grass in our backyard these past 5 years!</description>

      <description>Heard round the circus this past week…
From my 4 year old:
“Your right hand can’t know what your left hand is doing…unless your giving a hug, then it’s ok.”

Again from my 4 year old:
After pouring peroxide on her cut, she looked up at me with tears in her eyes and said, “Mom, that burns like Sprite!” (soooo hard not to laugh while she was obviously in pain)</description>

      <description>For the past four and half years, this has been her “go to” position for comfort. 
As a baby it was great… she totally self soothed… no pacifiers to chase down or beloved blankey to snuggle. Just pop her index and middle fingers in her mouth backwards and start rubbing her ear (or twirling her hair) and she could instantly calm herself to sleep. We knew of course this would have it’s trade off.</description>

      <description>My son has loved baseball since he was 2. A fan of his own right. Loves it inside and out. But, I thought last year the flame might die. Or be killed a slow and painful death.
It was a painful combination of not yet seeing a winning baseball game in his life and playing on a team which didn’t win a single game all season, topped off with having a coach that didn’t coach, just yelled in frustration at the discouraged players.</description>

      <description>I don’t homeschool because I hate the government. Nor do I homeschool because I think the public school system is all evil. Nor do I homeschool because I want my kids to be smarter than yours. In fact, raising super smart kids isn’t even my main goal of education.
I homeschool because I want to spend the time with my kids. That’s it, in a nut shell.
But, if I may be honest and come clean with you, it’s hard.</description>

      <description>This past week our oldest son turned 8. As quickly as that time seems to have flown, it is frightening to me to realize in just as little time, he’ll be waving goodbye as he backs a car out of the driveway. AACK! In the midst of this busy stage of life, I want to take time to reflect on who he is now at this stage, so I can cherish and savor it for years to come.</description>

      <description>Some people like the feeling of sand beneath their toes. I must say I do enjoy the squish of wet sand beneath my feet as the waves lap at my ankles. My children, however, have a whole different kind of love of sand.

One which truly baffles my mind.

EVERY SINGLE TIME we visit our community beach, it’s the same routine. We drop our stuff in the sand and they make a mad dash for the water, they splash and play and swim and then, inevitably, they decide it’s time to hit the sand.</description>

      <description>Spring break was FABULOUS! Oh my, what a treat to have an entire 6 days off of school. It was like a foretaste of summer vacation, (which for this homeschooling family is just around the corner). But before we get back to the books tomorrow, thought I’d share a few of our favorite memories from the week. We crafted…


We made memories with friends

      <description>It’s been really neat to watch the bond between my oldest and youngest. Our baby was the answer to his older brothers prayers, as he longed to have a little brother. I’ll never forget the look of pure joy when he found out he finally had a baby brother. I know he can’t wait for the day when they can truly play together, but for now it is so neat to see the love between them blossom.</description>

      <description>March was a rough month at the circus. Scott had some deadlines at work which meant he worked a lot of overtime. This happens with his work and we’ve all learned to roll with it, but that doesn’t mean that the long days don’t eventually start to take their toll. On all of us
Which is why it’s been so great the last 2 weeks having Scott around more often. Last Monday he left work at 2 to go to DC with us, on Friday he got home at 5:30 (to which my oldest son asked, “Dad did you take vacation time to get home this early?</description>

      <description>Countless “winter” afternoons were spent sporting flip flops, eating picnic lunches outside, soaking in the warmth of the sun’s rays. And I loved every minute of it, while also inwardly fearing a return of cold weather. I so hate that time of year when you have to keep both warm and cold weather clothes in your drawers because you never know what the weather will do. I love it when you can confidently box up last seasons clothes and fully embrace the new season.</description>

      <description>I really wanted to take the kids in to DC this spring to see the Cherry Blossoms. It’s not something we do every year, in fact, I think I’ve been only a handful of times in the 27 years I’ve lived in Maryland. But, this year, I thought it’d be fun to go and was thinking we might even have a free weekend during their peak blooms. But, thanks to the warm winter we had, they peaked early and there was NO chance of going during their peak week as it just didn’t fit with our schedules.</description>

And, I gotta come clean on this one… it was WAY cooler than I thought it would be. They built the rockets at home and then went to the field to stuff them and other technical stuff which I didn’t really follow all to closely.

Then they set the rockets up on their “launch pads”</description>

      <description>Our tutorial had its Science/History night on Monday. As with any special event, it’s taken a few days to come up for air following all the pre event preparations…. As I watched tired mother’s dragging ginormous projects into the gym on Monday morning, I realized this is one of the major reasons we’re at our tutorial. Science/History night gives them an opportunity to get up in front of a group of people and perform something.</description>

And today was just that.
I was so excited to have St Patrick’s Day fall on a Saturday this year. After our magically delicious breakfast, Scott took the big 3 to my son’s baseball practice. I stayed home to make our lunch (shamrock shaped soft pretzels) while our youngest took a morning cat nap.</description>

A lot.
I know I never, ever babied any of my others like I do him. It’s mostly because I know he’s my last, but also because he lets me. He weighs 27 lbs

and will be 2 in three months, and yet most days you’ll find me carrying him on my hip. I joked the other day that you’ll probably find me carrying him in to kindergarten.</description>

      <description>My youngest often wakes up early in the morning… you know that tricky hour of the day when it isn’t yet time for anyone to be awake but yet close enough to morning that if you let him cry it out a bit they’ll probably wake up and it’s way earlier than you want more than one child up seeing as it’s earlier than you even want to be up. You know that time of the night/morning?</description>

      <description>While we didn’t plan it like this at first, Sunday ended up being date day for each of our 4 kids. Each child ended up with some one on one time with either mom, dad, or Aunt Karen. Good times had by all!
One of the duties of our church deacons is to unlock the church on Sunday mornings. When Scott became a deacon 3 years ago, he started taking one child with him on his deacon duty mornings.</description>

6 years old.
It just sound so old… so, not a baby, not a toddler, not a preschooler, but a… girl. I spent some time looking back at pictures and videos this past year and I realized that 5 is a significant year. She grew up A LOT this past year.
She started school.
She learned to read.
She learned to add and subtract.</description>

      <description>More times than not, when I peek in on my girls before heading to bed, I find them sleeping together. Sometimes this means they are both down on the bottom bunk.

Sometimes, it means they are side by side in their drawers (truthfully I find them like this almost as often as I find them in the bottom bunk). 

Sometimes they are both on the floor. (haven’t found them like that in the last 2 weeks)</description>

      <description>For all those wondering if there is truly hope for the hopeless… those who’ve made their resolutions and long since broken them… for those that thought, perhaps your just destined for failure…. to those… I offer this little glimmer of hope….
Our last visit to the library—if that trip didn’t redeem us, I don’t know what will!
Those who have been long time readers here at the circus… might recall I have a bit of a bad history with the library… first, we have the whole circus family wing of the library thanks to the $18 fine visit and the $42 fine visit.</description>

      <description>Truthfully, the circus family doesn’t spend much time on bikes. We do a lot of fun things here, don’t get me wrong, but there are only so many hours in a day, and teaching our kids to ride bikes has not been where we’ve spent ours.
But, today the sun was shining, the weather was unseasonably warm here in MD again, and as the kids played in the backyard while Scott did yard work, our oldest daughter decided that today she wanted to ride her bike without training wheels.</description>

      <description>Nothing like a surprise package of clothes in the mail to bring smiles to the girls faces and provide an impromptu photo opp. (the boys appreciated it too, but not to the same extent)



Thanks cousins Ben and Eli!</description>

      <description>I think 4 is a great age for a lot of reasons… one of which is the funny little things 4 year olds say…

Today we were walking to the van and she was carrying her coat, Kit, and her baby. I said, “If you wear your coat you’ll have more hands.” to which she said, “No, Mom, I’ll still only have 2 hands.” Last week before she went into her gymnastics class I told her to work hard and have fun.</description>

      <description>This afternoon my smiley, mild mannered, easy going baby suddenly channeled his inner Dennis the Menace and went all toddler boy on me for 30 minutes. First I looked over and found him standing on his tool bench (oops look who forgot to put away the advent calendar with her Christmas decorations)

I got him down and shortly after realized things had been mighty quiet for awhile and went searching for him.</description>

      <description>Every now and then, when I peek in on my oldest daughter before going to sleep, I’ll see something which instantly takes me back to her infancy. 
And even though she’ll be 6 in a few short weeks, I see her as this sweet little 8 month old in her crib, sleeping folded in half. I’ll remember how she used to sleep like this every.single night… and suddenly all these pictures of her sleeping like this pass through my mind like a slide show.</description>

      <description>We had some trees and branches cut down in our yard yesterday. Thus far I think it was worth every penny as I love the new look of our yard, the feeling of safety knowing those dead branches aren’t going to come down in the next storm, AND the free babysitting it provided yesterday afternoon.

The tree in front of our living room window provided the most excitement. Even my 18 mth old was so intrigued, he kept looking out the window and then he’d yell, “Hey Mama” and a whole bunch of gibberish followed by “Hey Mama”… I swear with that gibberish, he was telling me “there’s a man flying outside our window!</description>

      <description>We were delightfully surprised with some big puffy flakes of snow on Monday afternoon which accumulated to a whopping 1/2 inch of fun for the big 3. 
This was the first “real snow” we’ve had here all winter. The pure, unadulterated glee which this brought to my children caused me to pause and give thanks that we live in MD.

Because it doesn’t snow here all the time (a fact that I am truly, truly grateful for) when it does it is cause for excitement and celebration.</description>

      <description>When talking to my oldest daughter about things to look forward to in 2012, I mentioned to her that the Summer Olympics were going to happen in 2012.
“Oh,” she exclaimed, “I’ll be 6, can I be in the Olympics?”
I told her that when she was 6 she can try out for the gymnastics team at her gym, but she has to be 16 to try out for the Olympics.</description>

      <description>Since we were blessed with yet another mild December day on the 31st, we decided to take advantage of the time off, unseasonably warm weather, and the last day of our pass for a family fun afternoon at the zoo.  Make a mental note… for a really good visit to the zoo, try going on a mild day in the off season, shortly before closing time… hardly any people were there and the animals were quite active.</description>

As we spent time reflecting on 2011, Scott and I both found ourselves commenting on how grateful we are for our life. We don’t deserve this life of comfort and good fortune.</description>

      <description>It’s been a LOOOOONG time since I’ve posted about Shopping for Sudan, but as 2011 comes to a close I thought I’d say thanks to those of you that participated with me in Shopping for Sudan. In 2011 you raised $47 dollars to help the people of Sudan. It may not seem like much but it’s a lot to the people who receive it. Furthermore, we are still matching the amount raised and so a total donation of $100 was made on your behalf.</description>

      <description>The most favorite Christmas cookie for the circus fam to make is sugar cookies. Messiness + sugar = pure bliss for the circus crew!!


  This year we enjoyed rolling and cutting the cookies with our cousin Eli. 

 It was also the first year that the youngest circus crew member got to participate in the cooking making fun. And by participate, I of course mean, eating.</description>

      <description>When I uploaded my last video to you tube, I got side tracked with a little trip down memory lane as I then watched other videos the circus fam has posted to you tube in the past.
And I came across this gem.
A few things I noticed while re watching the video.
1. My oldest son used to have that cute 4 year old voice you swear you’ll never forget but inevitably do.</description>

      <description>When I saw the sign on the side of highway advertising a Live Nativity, I was instantly interested. I’ve never seen one and thought it would be a great experience for the kids. When talking to a friend I found out more details and made plans to bring them. It was a simple production, put on by a small community church on a cold winter’s night on the side of a busy highway.</description>

      <description>We decorated our gingerbread house this weekend…before Christmas this year—astonishing, I know.
The big 3 had a fabulous time.


Unfortunately, our youngest found the experience quite confusing and a tad frustrating. “Why, oh why, aren’t they letting me eat that candy?”

I might have snuck the lil guy a few pieces of candy while they were busy working.


The kids were quite proud of their work.</description>

      <description>Scott took a vacation day on Thursday so he could spend the day with our oldest daughter. First they went with the other kids in her Kindergarten class to see a performance of The Night Before Christmas. Apparently the sets were gorgeous and the play was very well done. Such a treat to go to a live theatre AND to get to see it with her school friends and Dad. I think it was also a treat for Dad to get to see her with her school friends, it’s an aspect of her life that he doesn’t get to see very often.</description>

      <description>I was an elementary school teacher for 3 years. We used butcher paper all the time for bulletin boards. I’ve also seen it cleverly used at restaurants in place of a tablecloth to give a space for the kids to doodle while waiting. Never… in all my years did I really stop to think why it was called butcher paper.. or what the actual intent of the paper was for. Scott and I got the idea to get the kids a roll of butcher paper to keep on our dining room table.</description>

      <description>Since my oldest lost his first tooth, last spring, the tooth fairy has made 4 more visits to the circus. And judging by the giant front tooth dangling from my oldest sons top row, I think she’ll be back again this week!
As you may recall, we pulled my son’s first tooth in a very unconventional manner. His second tooth was pulled the normal way by dad. For his third tooth, he was very eager to pull it himself when his grandparents were here, so they could see.</description>

      <description>We had a super fun time at the aquarium today for our tutorial fieldtrip. And although we’ve taken the kids two other times over the past 7 years, I think they had way more fun getting to go with their friends…which proves Piglet was right, “It&amp;rsquo;s so much more friendly with two.” (or 40)

Having gone twice before, I kinda wasn’t expecting to enjoy it as much as I had before… yet, I found myself amazed yet again at the incredible creatures our God has created…and I saw things I have never seen before…</description>

Love decorating it and passing on the memories to my children of the precious ornaments hung on our tree…

Love the wonder of the lights…

Love watching them play with toys that only come out once a year…

Love seeing them act out the story of Christ’s birth as they play with their nativity sets

And this year I love listening to the sounds of Christmas carols fill the house as my son plays them on the piano</description>

      <description>Education is about so much more than book smarts. I’ve known this for awhile and believed it to my core. In fact, this fact alone has dictated so many decisions we make in raising our children, especially since we home school and want to make sure that they are learning more than just “reading, writing, and arithmetic.”
Yesterday and today our school time was “interrupted” so that I could spend time one on one disciplining a child for behavior.</description>

I am not complaining… I willingly signed up for all of these things (ok… except for the overtime part) and I enjoy them… it’s a stage of life for us that is fleeting, I know.</description>

      <description>I never considered myself to be high maintenance till I started shopping at Aldi’s. All my friends had been going there for years and always seemed to gush about the great prices and the fact that their generic off brands were just as good if not better than name brands. I went once but hated the fact that it didn’t have everything on my list, plus it wasn’t really on my way to or from any place (except church but Sunday after church is not a good time to go grocery shopping—believe me I know, I tried this past week)… so I got along with Shoppers and Safeway, but the grocery bill kept getting higher… I then added Walmart to my list… not close or convenient to where I live, but was saving a lot of money… and then I decided to try Aldi’s again.</description>

      <description>Our oldest daughter had a little fun getting into her character for Halloween. When posing for pictures in their costumes, she decided to fully act out the part of Snow White.

I think my favorite part of the reenactment was when she asked us to take her picture sleeping with the apple. &amp;quot;Skip the ol posing by the door with the trick or treat basket, we’ll go for playing dead on the floor with an apple.</description>

1 founding father

2 princesses

and one super hero?

Enough candy to last you till Easter!

One last question: How many licks does it take to get to the center of Tootsie Pop?</description>

      <description>My oldest son seems to jump from obsession to another… You can almost mark each year of his life with a theme…when he was 4 it was Spiderman… he was Spiderman for Halloween had a Spiderman birthday party when he turned 5 and everything we played/talked about… was Spiderman…. until the next year when he was Bumblebee for Halloween had a Transformers birthday party that spring… then came Star Wars and hat was an EPIC obsession… I swear for a good solid year all and I mean ALL we talked about was Star Wars… I learned so much about the characters and movie plots during that year.</description>

      <description>As my 4 yr old sat coloring in the waiting room this afternoon the mom beside me commented on her neat job of staying in the lines. Then we both did a double take and looked over at each other. 
Don’t  mind the fact that the dress is green and should “really” be yellow… I love the fact that my girl goes against the flow and colors it how she wants… sure give Belle purple hair and a green dress.</description>

      <description>On the wall in my bedroom, tucked away in the corner on my side of the bed is a shadow box in which I pressed some dried flowers from my wedding bouquet. I’ll confess I don’t look at it often, but when I do I smile and remember that special day.
My children, however, don’t share my sentimentality.
The other day my 5 yr old and I were sitting on my bed and she said, “Mom, why do you have those old dead flowers hanging on your wall?</description>

      <description>The other day I was driving my oldest two children home when they suggested I text their Nana to see if the younger two were asleep so we’d know if we needed to enter in the backdoor.
I told them I couldn’t text while driving, but maybe if I got a red light I could send her a quick txt. (I know, I know….)
Well the light was green and as we got rather close to our street my 5 yr old daughter says, “Mom, you gotta send the text!</description>

      <description>Scott and I got away last week, just the 2 of us, for 3 nights in the Windy City. It was a belated 10 year anniversary gift to ourselves.
And it was WON-DER-FUL!!
The city of Chicago is beautiful. The buildings are unique and interesting… truly works of art in and of themselves. We had so much fun walking around the city and taking in its beauty. The weather was overcast and it rained off and on while we were there.</description>

      <description>I learned this weekend that a friend and former MOPS mentor mom of mine passed away suddenly in her sleep. The suddenness and surprise of her passing took me quite off guard. My heart has been so heavy since I heard the news. Aside from my grandparents who both suffered long illnesses before their death, this is really the first person close to me that I’ve known whose died. She wasn’t just a person that I recognized or said Hi to on Sunday morning.</description>

      <description>You all know that the really talented crafty genes somehow skipped over me in the family tree. My girls are not going to get their wedding dress sewn by their Momma like I did. In fact there is a lot of doubt as to whether or not they’ll ever get the pajama pants I set out to sew them a year ago. But, I think I may have stumbled across a medium which I can do, and do with confidence.</description>

      <description>During the intro for of one of the speakers at the Women of Faith conference last month, they asked the speaker what quality she valued most in a friend. She answered loyalty, but my answer was a resounding…
realness
If you want to win me over/endear me for life, let me see your imperfections… do me a favor, don’t clean before you invite me over…show up to my house for a play date late… with a head full of wet hair… let me see your van full of cheerios and wrappers and those “lovely” Sunday School papers which seem to multiply and grow wings and threaten to over take your car.</description>

      <description>While we’ve been “doing school” at home for the past few weeks for the purpose of reviewing and getting used to the routine, today was the first official start of our new school year.
We homeschool, but also use a tutorial. The kids attend the tutorial twice a week and study at home with me three days a week. So far, I feel it provides the balance our family needs between homeschooling and traditional schooling.</description>

Right now I have mounds, literally mounds of unwashed clothes and dishes to take care of, shirts to tye dye, food to buy, and our annual Labor Day weekend to prep for… but I wanted to stop and preserve a few moments that I didn’t want to forget…</description>

      <description>6 Flags Amusement park offered a free ticket to any K-6 grade student that registered for their Read to Succeed program and completed 6 hrs of non school required reading. As a bonus, the teacher who enrolled the student also got a free ticket. So, that meant this home schooling momma got a ticket for herself and her son to 6 Flags.
I kept track of his reading in the spring and when he completed 6 hrs of recreational reading, unannounced to him, I registered him for the free ticket.</description>

      <description>Scott and I have a few sayings that we use often with the kids.
Life is not Fair
Life isn’t Always About You
You Can’t Cry to Get What You Want
and….
Never Trust a Bad Guy
1 -3 are pretty self explanatory… in a family of 6, you learn quickly that your not going to get what you want when you want it, you gotta wait, and that’s just the way it goes.</description>

      <description>My daughter is a fierce competitor. Everything, and I mean everything can be turned to a competition with her. Last weekend when we were driving back to the camp site from training camp, Scott and I drove my parents van and let my parents follow us with the kids in our van. We pulled in to Dairy Queen as a fun surprise and she says to my dad, “Now’s your chance to beat them… keep driving Papa!</description>

      <description>Of the 32 years I’ve been a Steelers fan, I only had the joy of being a hometown fan for only 8 of those years (5 of which I was 5 and under so it doesn’t really count in my book). My sophomore year of college, I moved to PA for 3 years. I was thrilled to get to watch the Steelers on a weekly basis. Unfortunately, this was during the Kordell Stewart, Tommy Maddox era, which wasn’t exactly the Steelers golden era of football.</description>

      <description>Time and time again our fourth child has blown us away with his easy going, flexible, happy-go-lucky approach to life. It has made the transition to a family of 6, for this family on-the-go, SO MUCH easier—a fact I am truly, truly grateful for.
This weekend, he really went above and beyond our expectations though.
Not only did he fall asleep in the tent both nights, while the rest of us were out at the camp fire, but he even napped in the tent Saturday morning.</description>

I often joke that she was born trying to keep up with her sister and brother. It’s true though. She is always ahead of where she should be b/c she has never wanted to be left behind. As such, whenever her birthday rolls around I don’t have that typical, “How can it have been 4 yrs already?” feeling, more often we’re like, “Really, your just now 4… seems like you’ve been 4 for awhile now.</description>

      <description>While our world wind trip to and from Florida went off really without a hitch, the 48 hrs since pulling into our driveway have been anything but smooth sailing.
Allow me to complain… We got home at 9pm on Sunday night… we unloaded what we had to, put the kids to bed and sat on the couch. Monday morning was back to reality… Scott had to be at work at 8, and the oldest two had to be at church at 8:45 for VBS.</description>

Shuttle launch in the morning, nap in the afternoon, beach in the evening, and free Chick-Fil-A right before bed… it was a perfect day in Florida… totally worth the 32 hours of driving it took to get there and back.</description>

We planned our entire vacation around the November launch. And while our trip to Florida last November, was one of our best family vacations ever, we didn’t get to see a launch.</description>

      <description>While looking through pictures recently, I stumbled across a few which truly captured life at the circus in its essence.
Exhibit A: taken in December of 2010

Here they are working on the pine wood derby car for Cub Scouts. Notice how everyone, even the baby, is in on the action? Noticed the leotard? My girls wear leotards every.single.day…. even though gymnastics is only twice a week, I can guarantee you those leotards are on more often than that.</description>

This boy is adored by his siblings.
He really has been from day 1. And by day 1, I mean, the day Scott and I told them about the baby in my belly.</description>

      <description>Ya know that feeling you get when you look at your kids and you just wanna freeze time? You don’t want them to grow up, not one bit, so you just try your best to hold on to the moments while you can.
Well, we figured out a way to freeze time here at the circus…just a little…

Our littlest crew member turned one earlier this month. Not sure how that year flew by so fast.</description>

      <description>I have a little header on my right side bar that says “One Year Ago” though it will actually list posts from this date either 1, 2, or 3 yrs ago. (Can you believe Life At The Circus is over 3 yrs old?) 
Every now and then I will see blog title under One Year Ago and it will catch my eye. I think that tab alone is the motivation for me to keep blogging lately.</description>

      <description>Last week after telling my kids the Bible story of baby Moses, I decided to offer a little application for them. I pointed out how neat it was that God took care of Moses as a baby by allowing the princess to find him. I even told how amazing it was that his own mother was allowed to take care of him before he went to live at the palace. After discussing how Moses grew up in the Egyptian palace, I pointed out how God used that later in his life when Moses led the Israelites out of captivity in Egypt.</description>

      <description>I was so glad Scott had the camera handy to snap this shot of our oldest daughter trying to use the view finder at the zoo the other day.

Too short to see through the peep holes?
No problem, I’ll just hoist myself up there with my own 2 arms and take a closer look.
Yea…at 5 she’s already stronger than her mom. No way I could do a chin up, and hold it!</description>

      <description>One of the many reasons why life is easier this time around is that my older three kids are much more self sufficient.
When we need to head out the door, I can instruct the kids to get their shoes on, go to the van and buckle up. A few minutes later the baby and I arrive at the van. I buckle him in, do a quick seatbelt check on the big kids and we hit the road.</description>

      <description>They say having kids changes things.
And they are right, it does.
I remember so vividly after our first son was born. My heart had grown at least triple in size. As I held him in my arms, it was love, pure love at first sight. But, in addition to that, my love for Scott, had quadrupled as well. I never felt more supported, more cared for, more in awe, than I did that first night after becoming parents.</description>

      <description>With Fathers Day approaching this weekend and the kids and I brainstorming ways to make it ultra special for the circus dad, I feel it also appropriate to spend some time reflecting on my own father.
Because, when it comes to dad’s, I have been richly blessed. While in the throws of parenthood, I think many a parents wonders, “Is it making a difference? Do my kids even notice?” And the answer is a resounding “Yes!</description>

      <description>flag day Noun:
1. June 14, the anniversary of the adoption of the Stars and Stripes as the official US flag in 1777.
2. Justification for purchasing those fun patriotic outfits and crafts b/c “It’s not just for the 4th of July you can use them on Flag Day too”.

The kids enjoyed making their own American Flags out of ribbon. They will serve as a great patriotic decoration in our home through the 4th of July.</description>

      <description>There are few sounds I cherish more than that of my oldests son’s belly laugh. You just can’t help but smile when something strikes him as truly funny because his laugh is infectious.
Until recently nothing could bring out that laugh like Tom and Jerry or Snoopy. But, then I gave him his very first copy of Mad Libs. And as I listened to him laugh out loud while he filled it in and read it to himself on the couch, well, I had to grab the camera and snap a few pictures.</description>

      <description>This morning I was reminded what a great gift forgiveness is. It was a rough morning… the last day of a very busy week with not as much down time as we’re accustomed to. I felt the fatigue that morning with heavy eyes searching for the remote to buy me a few more moments of rest before I hit the to do list. I noticed the fatigue in children who quickly burst into tears or whiny screams over rather insignificant things.</description>

      <description>My girls had their Mini Olympics Show yesterday afternoon and I gotta tell you, I was one proud Momma as I watched them perform. Their class did a floor routine (which was super cute to watch) and then each girl had a chance to perform on the bars, trampoline, and tumble track. 


The event concluded with a trip to the medal stand for each girl and then the opportunity to pose for pictures afterwards.</description>

      <description>While we’re making him wait till the end of the month to savor his first taste of cake (at his party when his grandparents can be there to ooh and aah), we couldn’t let his day go by without some sort of yummy mess. Enter baby’s first donut for breakfast.

First, he ate each individual sprinkle off of the donut. 

Then, it was time to ditch the hat, and tack a dab at the icing… again using his fingers to scrape it clean.</description>

      <description>It was one of the best days of my life. Even though it seemed like the time would never arrive, finally it was time. The doors opened, and Scott’s best friend began playing Trumpet Voluntary on his trumpet. And dad and I began our walk down the aisle. I will never forget the look of love in Scott’s eyes as I walked toward him down that aisle. I have a picture of his face on my dresser so I can remember it always.</description>

He truly is Joy personified.
Never have I seen a more happy, more contented, more easy going baby. He showers us all with laughs and smiles.</description>

      <description>With temperatures in the nineties this weekend and heat indexes in the hundreds, I’d swear we were celebrating the 4th of July this weekend rather than Memorial Day. We seemed to have gone from winter to summer, with very little spring in between. Wasn’t it just a few short weeks ago we were bundled up at baseball practice in our coats and hats? 
The kids don’t seem to mind a bit.</description>

      <description>There were moments, many moments, this year when I doubted. I wondered if I was giving him what he needed, if he was on par with where the public school was. I wondered what I was thinking, was it worth the battles, and the mess around my house. Days when I shoved school work aside as I put dinner on the table before quickly rushing out the door for practice. Truthfully, the hardest thing for me is the mess… is letting the mess go so we can concentrate on school work.</description>

 The next year, we returned, but this time it was a family affair.
2009 brought us back to the same farm, this time with friends.

And 2010 found me once again at the fields pregnant, with many small children in tow.</description>

      <description>This weekend the family went on a Cub Scout camp out from Friday- Saturday evening. The kids have been begging to go camping again, and this over nighter was the perfect little get away for us. As an added convenience it was at a State Park not far from our house, so it was quite easy to pop home if you needed something and made it no big deal when we got a late start on Friday night.</description>

      <description>Before having kids, I used to go to my local Hallmark store and browse the selection of cards. It seemed there was always SOMEONE who could benefit from a little Hallmark cheer. I love cards. LOVE them… and prior to having kids I was pretty good about buying and sending them.
Somehow though bringing 2, then 3, now 4 active kids into a card store lost its appeal… something about them reaching out of their strollers and pulling card after card onto the floor while I was trying to find that perfect card made it loose its charm.</description>

We are busy, busy, busy with games and practices most every night… some nights we’re even double booked.
Many people look at my schedule and call me crazy. Why do you do this to yourself?
The answer is, honestly, two fold. 1. We love it.</description>

      <description>People often ask me what the girls do while I am doing homeschooling with my oldest child.

On Tuesday the answer was “take all the cushions off the couch and every single blanket and pillow they owned and build a fort”


 If I am distracted enough they even smoke a stogie or two in their fort. (just kidding those would be pretzel rods…I promise, but doesn’t this bottom picture look sketchy?</description>

*It was not me that showed up with the girls at gymnastics last Wednesday with their feet and legs covered in mud from our morning play date at the park. And as I wiped their legs down with wet paper towels it wasn’t me who was saying out loud so the other moms could over hear how “I gave them baths that morning but then took them to the park to play” Silly me should have known they’d find a pond and sea weed and a muddy field….</description>

It is now Monday… school resumes tomorrow, and today I am trying to catch up on laundry and dishes and cleaning… right now, we’re back from gymnastics and the kids are down for quiet time. I am thankful for an iced coffee and the fact that it is warm enough for a skirt and flip flops…oh how I love warm sunny days!</description>

      <description>Before having kids I watched/read excerpts from Shepherding a Child’s Heart by Ted Tripp. The premise that you need to do more than just manage behavior, but get to the heart of what is causing our child’s behavior, made a lot of sense to both Scott and I. And through the years I think we have tried to apply this approach to our parenting. But, there is something very different about reading a book before having kids and reading one with both feet in the trenches.</description>

      <description>I think there is something about the age of 3 that makes kids say some of the cutest things. Lately, our 3 year old has been cracking me up and I have to write them down lest I forget…
 Last week Scott was playing catch with our oldest son.&amp;amp;#160; She of course wanted a turn as well.&amp;amp;#160; Scott said sure and then she said, _**“Dad, can I get closer to you when I throw the ball, since I am a girl?</description>

      <description>Anyone who knows me, knows that I love Chick-Fil-A. So, when I found out that they were opening a new one in Pasadena AND they had a “Raving-Fan” contest on face book in which the winner would win a year of free Chick-Fil-A, I had to enter.
The contest: submit a photo of your favorite memory at Chick-Fil-A and explain it in 100 words or less.
My favorite memory at Chick-fil-A?</description>

      <description>Finally, she was legally aloud to cross the white line

and she loved every.single. moment!

At the beginning of the half one of the coaches asked if she was ready to stand with her on the side. Her response, “No. I want to play!” 
And play, she did… scoring 2 goals! (plus one in the other teams goal)

Her smile truly radiated the entire time she was out there.</description>

      <description>Last week I mentioned on face book that I love how Scott makes me a pot of coffee every morning.
And, I do.
Makes me smile each morning when I come to the kitchen and pour myself a cup.
And I smile again later that morning as I go back to top it off. Again… and again.
Thursday, however, I had to laugh when I went to pour my cup of coffee.</description>

      <description>The time had finally come for the tooth to be pulled. While our son was more than ready for it to come out, Dad was secretly uneasy about the venture. “He trusts me” Scott confided to me in the hallway, “What if I hurt him?” Then Scott got another one of his moments of sheer fatherhood brilliance.
“I’ll let him do it,” he declared.
He tied one end of the dental floss to his light saber and the other to his tooth.</description>

      <description>March in Maryland is always fickle. Short sleeves one day and winter coats the next.
You always know when the first “jacket less” day arrives, that it is just a tease. And try as you may to simply embrace and enjoy it, the next day when you have to scramble for your winter coat and hat, it is always a bit disappointing.
Having lived in Maryland for most of my life, I know this and expect it.</description>

I know that book is around here somewhere… I just gotta throw some of these papers out of the way first.

Don’t tell Mom it was me, kay? I’m just gonna sit over here and pretend those books were like that when I got here.</description>

      <description>Those of you that have been visiting the circus for awhile now, know that I am a big wimp. Particularly when it comes to driving. I don’t like driving AT ALL. In fact on all of our grand driving vacations as we go gallivanting around the country, I have driven a total of 0 miles. Scott always drives, I am always the copilot… I know it’s very 1950s of us. But it works.</description>

      <description>When my son asked if he could bring his light sabers or guns to his sisters first soccer practice, I said no. Because sometimes it is awkward to deal with the whole gun issue out in public.
Obviously I forgot that little boys will turn absolutely anything into a gun.
So today I said what the heck, bring the gun. Which apparently translated to, go crazy, carry a gun in each hand and a concealed weapon… Heck, why not wear the entire uniform!</description>

      <description>I asked Scott to explain Pi to the kids yesterday as we ate our Chicken Pot Pie in celebration of Pi day (3/14). I knew he would do a better job than I, as I would have probably just showed them the symbol and told them it equaled 3.14
Because folks, that pretty much sums up what I know about Pi.
He however drew them a picture of a circle, taught them about diameter and then went on to tell them that you need a little (.</description>

      <description>Lately I have found myself biting back tears and praying for wisdom as I work with my daughter on obedience and respect. These battles leave me tired and stretched and yearning for some chocolate chip cookie dough and a bottle of coca cola classic.
One battle area for us has been over her having to wear her eye patch. Seems the novelty has faded and she really doesn’t like wearing it.</description>

      <description>Exciting things are happening round the circus parts this week and it’s only Tuesday!!
Sunday, I ran a half marathon with my FIL. My friend, who had to run a half marathon in order to see me in real life, also ran but she was so stinking fast that I am glad I caught her in line for the potty before the race, b/c there was no seeing her after that.</description>

      <description>“Momma, don’t we look beautiful?”
As I praised them for their lovely fashion choices and snapped picture upon picture of their dress up fun, it dawned on me that this was an opportunity to reinforce what true beauty is. Ya know, I said. To be truly beautiful, you have to be kind and loving to others. In fact, you can be wearing the prettiest dress ever, but if you act mean and unkind to others, you aren’t beautiful.</description>

      <description>There are all kinds of people in the world. Some morning people, some night owls. I truly think your propensity towards one or the other is an inborn part of your personality. True, you can work on becoming more of a morning person (and society pretty much dictates this to some degree), ones natural inclination, I think, is innate.
For a glimpse of this, one must simply observe my two daughters.</description>

      <description>The time is 11:45pm. One tired hubby is doing his best to fall asleep so he can get up the next morning and go to work and provide for his family. Meanwhile his “endearing wife” keeps him awake chattering away about the fun festivities she has planned for the following week.
Because he is a good man, he kindly listens as I tell him about National Pancake Day and why it is celebrated, when I know that truthfully, he wants nothing more than to roll over and fall asleep.</description>

      <description>Ever since I saw the movie Space Camp, it’s been a desire of mine to see a space shuttle launch, up close and in person. I’m not a space nut or anything, but I do find the whole concept of space travel fascinating. And while I don’t have a technical bucket list, so to say, if I did, seeing a launch in person would most definitely be on that list. Which, is why we switched our vacation plans around last fall and took our family to Florida, to try and see the last launch of the Space Shuttle Discovery and one of the last U.</description>

Oh My!!

Apparently, I also need to have the “less is more” discussion with her on make up application. 
Unless of course she plans to be a clown when she grows up.</description>

Looking back, it was a great season. We had a ton of fun cheering for our boys in black and gold.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago my FIL approached me about running in a local half marathon with him at the beginning of March. Because I seem to require a race to motivate me to run, I was eager to accept. However, it only left me about 7 weeks to prepare and I was not in running shape, having only run a handful of times since my son’s birth last June. I found some training guides online (both of which suggested 12 weeks to prepare) and spent a good amount of time face booking and e-mailing with a friend about my strategy.</description>

But today, it doesn’t bother me. (ok, it doesn’t bother me too much anyway)…
because…
Today, I finally took the time to snuggle on the couch with my almost 5 year old and work with her on reading… and today that precious light bulb went off as she first went up and down the blend ladders and then graduated to three letter words.</description>

      <description>I’ve never known what it was like to be part of the home town team. Though I was born in Pa, I’ve lived in rival MD since the age of 5, not counting 3 of my 4 years of college. I got my love of football from my dad and my dad brought me up a Steelers girl. I now pass this legacy onto my four children. I just love this pic of our newest Steelers fan, I had to find a reason to sneak this in.</description>

      <description>Those of you that follow me on facebook or twitter, or have spent any time round these circus parts, know that I whine quite a bit about laundry. Recently, however, I made a startling discovery. Rather than being the bane of my existence as I once thought, it is in fact, the key to my happiness?
Say wha??
Last May, I set out with a quest to get entirely caught up on my laundry.</description>

      <description>As I watch my kids play together, I can’t help but think how my son has no idea how good he has it. Growing up, it was just me and my little brother and we’d often play together. I vividly recall playing GI Joe with him. It pretty much went the same way every time. I had the Princess Lea action figure and she would be married to either Shipwreck or Sgt Slaughter.</description>

      <description>Nothing like the holidays, to bring on some humor from the lil ones. Here’s a few I want to record for posterity.
When Scott was talking to my 4 yr old about what she wanted to get me for Christmas, she told him she wanted to get Mommy flowers and she was going to be nice. To clarify Scott asked, “So your going to be nice as a Christmas gift for Mommy?</description>

      <description>I wasn’t aiming for some idealist, Kodak winter moment. Just an evening of winter fun with the kids. With the baby dropped off at my in laws, Scott and I set out for an evening on the ice with the big 3. Scott had his reservations and voiced them a few times. But, I was confident we’d be fine. 
Once we were all laced up and approaching the rink, my confidence began to waver.</description>

      <description>Ever year it is the same… I beg and plead for just one small Christmas Eve miracle, a picture of my kids in front of the tree. The last few years as they’ve gotten older, it has actually gotten easier, thanks to a slight guilt trip from Daddy (do this for Mommy please, as your Christmas gift to her). I thought it might be fun after sharing this years picture to look back on Christmas’s Past.</description>

      <description>A few moments from this weekend which I wish to savor…
1. My son presenting his gift to his extended family. (One nap time he came up excited to share that he had drawn a picture from each scene in Luke 2. On Christmas he gave one picture to each person. He then laid them all out on the floor and recited the story from memory.)


2. Prepping the Christmas Lasagnas with my daughter… it marked a milestone, in which she was truly helpful in the kitchen.</description>

      <description>Just a few of my favorite pictures of our fun on Christmas morning!
Someone got a lil sleepy waiting up for Santa

The grandparents eagerly waiting for the kids to wake up on Christmas morning.

Does this capture the excitement of Christmas morning, or what? (I wish knew what had just been opened)

      <description>The week has been full of shopping, cleaning, baking, laundry, card writing, visits with friends, and last minute preparations for the festivities at the end of the week. But, in the midst of all the hustle and bustle, I’ve had a few precious moments which I want to quickly record lest I forget them in days gone by.
Monday evening I took my 4 year old daughter shopping for her sister’s Christmas present.</description>

      <description>When cutting down a tree, much like when shopping for a dress, there seems to be an unwritten rule of conduct.
No matter how fabulous it looks, you simply can’t go with the first one you see.
One simply can’t drive to the farm, march down the aisle, and stop at the first decent looking spruce you see.
That would be far too easy. Where would the fun be in that?</description>

      <description>It happened again…I sat curled up on the couch, reading page after page of Solomon’s Puzzle, until before I knew it, the clock struck midnight. While I didn’t turn into a pumpkin, it did make waking up the next morning rather difficult… especially coupled with nursing a sick baby. Yes, I hold Loris Nebbia, author of Solomon’s Puzzle, strictly responsible for the fact that my son was late for his tutorial twice last week.</description>

      <description>I found my 3 yr old like this during nap time today… it seems baby doll has been displaced from her bed. 
It reminded me of a picture I snapped a few weeks ago of both on my girls as we found them when we peeked in on them before going to bed.

YES… they are both sleeping INSIDE of their drawers!
And since I am sharing sleeping pics, why not share a few of my lil man snoozing as well?</description>

      <description>You’d think doing this 3 times over already, I would have been prepared.

And yet, once again, my breath has been taken away. I have fallen, and hard.
 
With your irresistible smile, your easy going personality, and your snuggly hugs, I am smitten. 
How can it be that 6 months have already passed since you joined our family? In some ways it seems like you were just born yesterday and in others it seems like you’ve always been a part of our family.</description>

“We were walking in the mall on Black Friday. We went to the Build a Bear shop which had been transformed into Santa&amp;rsquo;s Workshop for Christmas. They had stuffed snowmen and deer and Santa bears.</description>

      <description>I have had a fabulous week. We took the week off of school, and aren’t going anywhere but here. This weekend we did some much needed, long overdue DEEP CLEANING. I literally stayed in my PJs till 5:00 on Saturday and started in my bedroom cleaning and organizing till the dust bunnies under my bed were all sucked up by the Dyson! (in the middle of this day when my house looked like a tornado hit, the breakfast dishes were still on the table and I was still in my pjs my MIL showed up to take the kids for a few hours… a blessing so valuable and appreciated I swallowed my pride and opened the door so she could pick up the kiddos)</description>

      <description>It became quite clear to us that our little man was ready to try solid foods when he started opening his mouth like a baby bird anytime we were eating with him on our lap. We couldn’t help but laugh when he started reaching out for Daddy’s fork, mouth wide open, just begging for a taste.

Here he is holding our Smores ingredients while on vacation… his poor pathetic face seems to be saying, “They aren’t even nice about it!</description>

      <description>Every year I have high hopes for being on top of things in the Christmas season. Last year, as hard as I tried, I was no where near on top of things. In fact, my Christmas cards became New Years cards and weren’t even mailed till the middle of January. 
This year, however, I have high hopes. Thanks to a special promotion from Shutterfly, I have already designed my Christmas cards!</description>

      <description>We decided to add a little pizazz to our normal morning chaos as we got ready to leave for our tutorial today. Since it’s the last day the tutorial is meeting before Thanksgiving, they had a Harvest Party at the end of the day and the children were encouraged to come in costume.
My son went as an Indian and his little sister went as a Pilgrim. (costumes courtesy of Mommy’s costume bin from her school days… I was Pocahontas one year for Halloween and the “Pilgrim” dress was actually a costume from a church play).</description>

      <description>When a tour company approaches you as you board their boat offering the chance to back out with a full refund, a normal person would heed the warning, take the money and run.
But we aren’t normal. Because we have a quest to visit every national park during our married life together. And this quest brought us all the way down to Key West. And we didn’t drive all the way down to Key West only to turn around and head 100 miles north without first taking a boat 70 nautical miles further west to Dry Tortugas National Park.</description>

      <description>Our time at Biscayne National Park was fun, but way too short. We took a 3 hour tour (which thankfully turned out much better than the infamous 3 hr tour). I think the kids favorite part was the 45 minute ride out to Boca Chita Island. They described their ride out their as “the best rollar coaster ride ever!” The wind was really blowing. I thought it felt much like those super sonic hand dryers that look like they are ripping your skin off.</description>

      <description>When we arrived at Everglades NP it was shortly before midnight and raining quite hard. Scott got out of the van to attempt to put up the tent, but when he remembered the top of our tent is open screen (which we then put a cover over after set up) he realized it would be futile as the entire inside of the tent would be soaked before we even set it up.</description>

      <description>Because we were only planning to do one day in Disney (I hope to take the whole family back later for a longer Disney vacation when all of the the kids are old enough to truly enjoy and appreciate it. This day in Magic Kingdom was just to hold them me over for the next 5 years or so) I didn’t even try to pretend we’d be able to do or see it all in one day.</description>

      <description>We chose this year and even this specific week to take our Florida trip because the Space Shuttle Discovery was supposed to make it last launch into space. Both Scott and had always wanted to see a shuttle launch and being as it is one of the last launches ever, we really wanted to take the kids to see this historical event.
The launch was originally planned for Mon Nov 1st.</description>

      <description>Normally, I consider myself pretty laid back. Messy faces, germs, they all go with the territory of life with small kids and I don’t sweat em.
Then last year we took our grand Texas vacation… during which you may recall I caught the circus children licking the airplane window.
Then we spent our grand Texas vacation with multiple ear and sinus infections, suspected pink eye, laryngitis, and asthma episodes culminating with a day at a clinic in downtown San Antonio.</description>

      <description>I didn’t really know my great grandparents. All but one had passed away before I was born and my GG died when I was 2. I have one fleeting memory of her sitting in a chair in my grandparents dining room, but the rest I get from stories and pictures.
October could have been deemed “Great Grandparent Month” at the circus. My children are so blessed to have 4 living great grandparents in their lives today.</description>

      <description>I got my love of sports from my dad. I can remember watching Pirates games at 5 when he was out of town, just to make me feel closer to him. In high school, my dad would take me to Penn State Football games to watch my cousin play in the Blue Band. I think my dad made sure that we attended every kind of professional sporting event at least once.</description>

*Today I tried to do 2 days worth of school in one morning since we’ll be out of town on Monday
*Today I made banana chocolate chip pancakes for breakfast</description>

      <description>The outing started out so beautiful and picturesque. The drive there was lovely… leaves just starting to change, sipping my pumpkin spice latte, even the clouds looked “fall like” (amazing how everything looks lovely when the kids aren’t requiring you to referee from the drivers seat…thank you Psalty the Singing Songbook) We got to the farm and the kids happily ate their lunches while I nursed the baby. Then we were off to pick apples.</description>

      <description>I love my daughter. Obviously, I know, but I love the head first approach she takes at life. She dives in, full force with no fear. And if she falls, it doesn’t bother her, she’ll pick herself up and dive again. She hasn’t had it easy in the health department. At 6 mths she had her first asthma episode. Since then, she’s dealt with nebulizer treatments with very little complaint. It’s a fact of life for her and she handles it well.</description>

      <description>I heard the alarm go off and was grateful when Scott woke to take the first shower. Shortly after I heard the enthusiastic chatter of my youngest daughter in the bathroom and I happily rolled over for a little more shut eye.
Next thing I know I hear Scott turn off the tv and gather the big 3 to “have a chat”. I then hear, “ Guys, what does Daddy do for her job?</description>

      <description>So many things I want to remember from this stage of life…the sweet way she mispronounces her baby brother’s name…. and the way his face lights up with recognition when I walk in a room…the raspy way she belts out songs in the back seat, and the sweet way he kisses his sisters goodbye before heading into school… I know I think I’ll never forget and yet those who’ve gone before me say I will.</description>

      <description>5 years ago this month, God took her home to heaven. Though the truth is, Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s/Dementia took Grandma from us long before then. At first she’d just forget what time we’d be leaving for church the next day or when we’d be eating dinner. Later she forgot her grandchildren, children, and eventually even her own identity. Bit by bit the disease took more of her. I remember walking into the care facility the weekend Scott and I had gotten engaged.</description>

      <description>A few pics to sum up the week and highlight a few of my favorite moments.

My favorite part of our home schooling day is the beginning. We start with the pledge and a very loud and off key rendition of The Star Spangled Banner. Warms my patriotic soul!
Q: What do home schoolers wear to school?

A: whatever they want.. ie leotards and camos
We made a discovery this week.</description>

      <description>It began innocently enough. It kind of drew me in with its rich, sweet aroma. For years I’d enjoy the hint of the flavor… in mud pies or Frappuccino&amp;rsquo;s…even an occasional cappuccino. But I wasn’t quite ready to sell out and drink a cup of joe for breakfast on a regular occasion. Then I went to our annual Labor Day getaway. Which, in addition to being a house full of my closest life long friends and their chillin’, was also a house full of serious coffee drinkers.</description>

      <description>Get out your 2011 calendars and circle Sept 19th. It is International Talk Like a Pirate day. I assure you it is one holiday you do not want to miss. (If, by chance, you happen to get the date wrong, ahem, and celebrate it on the 20th per say, no worries, your children won’t know the difference and you can still have just as good of a time). 
We celebrated in 2008, but sadly missed the holiday last year… something about being in my first trimester and starting my first year of home schooling, caused me to forego the optional holidays last year.</description>

      <description>As I left the house for my second sewing class I eagerly told Scott I’d return with 2 aprons in hand. I recall him lovingly tried to temper my expectations by suggesting even returning with one would be exciting, but I blew him off as ran out the door material, machine, and new sewing scissors in hand. I returned 3 hours later having sewed the neck strap for one of my aprons.</description>

Call it what you will, but I am sorry this circus mom has nothing to give ya. I’ve sat down and started posts 3 separate times this week only to stop half way through. I wanted to fill you in on our hamster wheel paced life the past few weeks but when I write it all out it just seems boring. Really, do you want to hear about the circus family’s daily routine?</description>

      <description>So long summer 2010….
We’ll forever hold you close in our heart for you were the summer that we welcomed dear sweet, squeezable number 4 to our fold.

We enjoyed your lazy hazy days as we spent time playing in our back yard and splashing in our pool…

We enjoyed time with family



We caught our first keeper… and enjoyed time on Nana and Pop’s boat.</description>

      <description>You may or may not have noticed that lately, I haven’t been blogging much. I can’t put my finger on why exactly.
 
It’s not his fault… he is super easy going. And it isn’t due to lack of fodder… the circus crew provides me with a never ending supply of bloggable material. But, my days have been “more full” lately. Our schedule includes home school, tutorial, gymnastics, soccer, (and cub scouts starting soon).</description>

      <description>The cool crisp mornings we’ve had lately signal that fall is near. So, this weekend I made good on a summertime promise I made to the kids. We carried out the folding table and chairs…decided on a fair price for our product and made some signs.

While the kids began chanting “25 cent lemonade,” I quickly stirred some country time and water.
They eagerly watched for cars and walkers and when they saw them they’d enthusiastically wave and chant.</description>

      <description>I do not consider myself to be either creative or crafty. And most of the time I am ok with that. Even though my mom and grandma are both talented seamstresses, I’ve often joked that I missed out on the sewing gene.
The truth is that sewing seems to require patience and an aspiration for perfection. And for me, close enough is usually more than good enough. But close enough doesn’t seem to work when sewing, b/c you kinda want your dresses to be straight and your sleeves even.</description>

      <description>There are many familiar and epic battles out there. At the circus, I am often subject to reading, watching, and even role playing in such battles over good and evil.
Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker fighting for the future of the galaxy.
Spiderman and Doctor Octopus dueling over the city of New York.
Optimus Prime and the autobots verses Megatron and the decepticons in their fierce battle over the fate of earth.</description>

      <description>It’s been one of those days… please tell me you know the ones…took the circus crew to the pediatrician’s for my 3 yr old’s check up. One would have thought by the amount of shrieking that took place in the hall that we were attempting to tie her down and give her 30 shots, when really we just wanted her to take her sandals off and stand on the scale. From that humbling spectacle we were off to the grocery store.</description>

      <description>Tonight the kids and I were enjoying a walk at the Naval Academy when we spotted a statue of their mascot, the goat, which prompted a rather comical discussion.
We talked about how the goats are the navy mascot, to which my 3 yr old responded, “But mom, goats aren’t scary.” I then said that the Army is afraid of them b/c when they play each other in sports (not war) then they are against each other and don’t want to lose to them.</description>

      <description>I clearly remember the first baseball game I attended with Scott. A coworker had given him the tickets and since we had no plans, we thought, “Sure, why not?” As we drove into Baltimore and hit traffic, Scott was in disbelief, “Could this be game traffic?” He asked. “I had no idea this many people liked baseball.”
Yea… clearly, we aren’t big baseball enthusiasts.
But, thanks to my oldest son, my children are.</description>

      <description>This weekend we were able to coordinate our schedules and have the opportunity to get together with my brother and his family for some play time. 
What gathering would be complete without a light saber battle?

I loved getting to watch my nephew and nieces play and to observe my brother playing with my children. There is something quite special, and indescribable about watching your children play with your sibling.</description>

The youngest circus member is thriving! At 2 and a half months he’s weighing around 15lbs. (my biggest baby yet). So far he is really easy going and super snuggly. A perfect combo for my youngest cast member. We’re on some what of a flexible schedule/routine, which is a huge praise, as we’re starting school next week with the older crew members! </description>

      <description>One of my favorite things about parenting, is watching my children interact with each other (when they aren’t fighting that is). It’s fascinating to me to see the differences in their bonds and relationships. One relationship which I have observed recently growing is that between my two girls. 

With only 17 mths, and a few inches and pounds between them, they are in so many ways peers. They share much in common, and yet are so very different.</description>

      <description>They’ve tried piers, ponds, worms, and lures. For three summers now he’s patiently pursued it. Casting and waiting. Enjoying the view and the time together. Each time, I’d ask if he had a good time. Each time he’d enthusiastically respond, “Yes!” Then I’d ask if he got a keeper and each time he’d respond in the negative. He’s caught a fish a few times, but not the illustrious keeper he sought after.</description>

      <description>When things didn’t work out for us to go camping this weekend as planned, we promised the kids a night of “camping-like” fun at home. Scott came home from work a little early and we cooked up hot dogs and baked beans (a fav here at the circus).
Then we spent the evening fishing on the river.

(more details on the fishing to come later this week)
Camping wouldn’t be complete without Smore’s so we roasted some mallows over the gas stove.</description>

      <description>Alternate Title: How Your Army Looks When You Have 2 Younger Sisters

I couldn’t help but smile when I looked out the window and saw this scene…makes me laugh when looking at it on the computer as well. Quite a motley crew we have defending the fortress… the leader in his camo’s with his walking stick (or staff as he refers to it), his trusty sidekicks following in their fairy wings, and Uncle Jim covering from behind with the ever elusive fluorescent double barrel shot gun.</description>

      <description>It’s that time again… the mailers, the prerecorded phone calls, and those signs covering any square inch of grass on the side of the road.
That’s right…election time in Maryland. Maybe it’s just me, but it seems people have hit the signs hard and a bit early this year. Typically I pay little to no attention to them. Sure I notice them in passing, but I barely read them and I don’t plan to make my vote in November based on the yellow sign I saw on the side of the road.</description>

      <description>6 years ago I watched my lil man proudly hold his head high during tummy time. I was so excited b/c he had recently learned to roll over. He was growing up so fast and I was thrilled with all he was learning and doing. I had no idea that in just 6 short years he’d be at Cup Scout camp with Daddy learning a whole slew of new things.</description>

      <description>The kids had scattered to the backyard to play while I cleared off the dinner dishes. As I wiped down the dining room table, I couldn’t help but smirk as I looked out over a see of crumbs and wood that is faded in parts due to many a knocked over glass of milk or water. There is an ever present layer of grime that those of you with kids know exactly what I am talking about… something like syrup meets peanut butter meets oatmeal and it just cakes into those nooks and crannies around the edge of the table, giving it that “lived in” feel.</description>

      <description>I have many fond childhood memories of working on crafts with my Mema. She’d come to visit and bring her puffy paints and we’d make tee shirts and sweat shirts. Once she even attempted to teach me to crochet… but after a few hours and only a few loops, I opted to let her continue making me anything I wanted crocheted. Now I am grown, with kids of my own, and I must confess, my craft skills don’t look a whole lot different than when I was a kid.</description>

      <description>A year ago today my SIL was due to have her first born, my sweet nephew Eli, who the circus children affectionately call “baby Ewi”. I can’t believe he turns one next week!! He’s in town this week eagerly awaiting the arrival of his daddy from Iraq for his R&amp;amp;R.
I am so thankful that I have a SIL who is willing to travel, b/c even though they live in El Paso, we’ve gotten to see them 4 times this past year!</description>

      <description>Our third born has literally been on the fast track since birth. I swear she was born holding her head up and eagerly chasing after her older 2 siblings, not wanting to be left out for even a second. She was clearly not meant to be the “baby” of the family.

Most of the time when my kids celebrate a birthday, I find myself reflecting on how quickly time passes and marveling at how could they be so old so fast.</description>

      <description>Math has never been my strong suit (except in 3rd grade, I did awesome with the multiplication tables and was the class champ at around the world, but that was b/c all I had to do was memorize facts and not understand the process)
Anyway, as I was saying… math has never been my gifting… and math at 3 am is certainly not my gifting. So, I calculated the hours again.</description>

Allow me to shed a little light to the back drop of this picture…

      <description>Dear Son,
When you grow up and notice that every time you talk people kinda take a step back from you… its not your fault.
You will have come by these socially awkward close talking tendencies quite naturally.
Blame your older sisters for your lack of personal space. Because they can’t seem to talk to you without their face literally centimeters from yours. 
Waking or sleeping, car seat, or bassinet or bouncy seat or swing.</description>

      <description>Divide and Conquer
That would be the name of the game lately at the circus.
I’ll take the youngest two to the grocery store while Scott takes the older ones with him to build the new to us play set. Or Scott takes the big 3 to the year end baseball ceremony while I stay home with the babe.
At this stage of the game, tag teaming has seemed crucial for surviving and for attempting to keep the household running somewhat smoothly.</description>

      <description>Because I am used to the chaotic and crazy lifestyle I live, I sometimes forget how it can look to the outsider. It feels normal to me to walk down the street with a gaggle of kids surrounding me, fighting or singing or playing (or all of the above). And when I combine my circus life with that of my close friend (whose blog could also easily be called Life At The Circus as she has 4 boys ages 5, 4, 3 and 3 months) well the chaos only multiplies.</description>

Not quite
Believe it or not, underneath that pile of circus cast members was our youngest child…

      <description>When I told you of the never ending science lessons going on at the circus this summer, I was excited about my children getting to watch the baby birds grow until they were old enough to fly from the nest. We learned that Daddy Robins help Mommy’s feed their babies, as we saw both the Mom and Dad at the nest at the same time. By day 3 we even started seeing their little beaks peak out over the top of the nest in our “Robin cam.</description>

      <description>I think I’ve mentioned before that my oldest three all share a room. This week the kids have started taking turns sleeping with the baby. Sunday night the boys got to sleep together. My oldest was so excited about sharing a room with his little brother. I couldn’t help but snap a picture as I peeked in on them before going to bed. 
When I went to look in on the girls I found them both cuddled up together on the floor… it appears they decided to have a sleep over of their ownThe next night my oldest daughter wanted to sleep with the baby.</description>

      <description>Just because it is summer, doesn’t mean we have to stop learning here at the circus. God presented us with a wonderful science lesson, right in our back yard. The best part is, I don’t even have to do any prep work for the lessonsA very brave and trusting Momma Robin built a nest under our deck. Apparently, she doesn’t require peace and tranquility to feel safe as our crew stomps back and forth across our deck belting out songs or squeals or tantrums from morning till night.</description>

      <description>Mark your calendars now for the 2024 Olympics… our little gymnast has started training! 
I must say I have truly enjoyed watching her at her gymnastics class this year. Since I can’t even do a forward roll, I am always so amazed as I watch her do back rolls or “flip overs” on the bars. Neither Scott nor I did gymnastics growing up so it is not a sport we would have normally thought of but she is so short, strong and flexible (remember she still sleeps folded in half) that we just had to get her involved.</description>

      <description>They say newborns don’t do much other than sleeping, eating, pooping, and crying. While that may be true, I gotta tell you the circus crew has not yet tired of watching their baby brother do these things. It’s been a week since we brought our little man home from the hospital. And every-single-time we have to change his diaper, one can hear a stampede of feet as the three of them race for a spot by the changing table to watch.</description>

      <description>Funny how time dulls the memory. It’s been 3 yrs since I’ve had a newborn around the house and it seems I forgot a few things, like….
 How many diapers a newborn goes through…this little man seems to poop, all-the-time, already went through the two small packs of newborn diapers we had in less than a week. Thankfully I had bought a huge box of Swaddlers size 1-2 which he can technically fit in and which totally saved the day night when we ran out of the newborn sized diapers in the middle of the night.</description>

      <description>When our son was 36 hours old we were getting ready to leave the hospital and the nurse came in for official discharge. Those of you who have had kids know this is the time they give you all those important instructions, “back to sleep”, “umbilical cord care….” Those of you who have had more then one kid know that this speech gets progressively less interesting with each discharge. While I am sure the nurse had Scott’s undivided attention the first time we heard the speech, he seemed easily distracted this time around.</description>

It actually starts out very similarly to my first birth story. The night before my due date Scott and I went to bed early and as we were going to bed Scott jokingly said, “Feel free to wake me at 3 am and tell me you are in labor.</description>

      <description>Our son was born at 10:27pm. Unfortunately, because he was born so late, his brother and sisters didn’t get to meet him until the next morning. We loved the first night with him but it felt like the birthing process was somehow incomplete until we were all together. When the moment finally came Scott brought them up and they eagerly ran to the bed to meet him. 
When I told them his name, my son’s face light up as it registered that he got the baby brother he was longing for.</description>

      <description>Typically, I try not to make this a picture blog or just a family scrapbook type blog. I try to mix it up a little with the blog content and I do my best to show restraint on pictures. (believe it or not)
Therefore I felt it necessary to give you a heads up that at least for the next week or so, there are going to be a lot of pictures on the blog.</description>

      <description>It’s time to stop pretending. The act is over. Who am I kidding?
I am not a gardener.
Each spring, I get bitten by a gardening bug and I think that I will turn over a new leaf and suddenly spawn a green thumb. So, I buy some plants and seeds and the kids and I set off to garden. Each spring Scott asks why am I doing this when I know what will happen.</description>

      <description>Check out the size of these diapers!! Have you seen anything so little? It’s been a long time since we’ve had diapers that small around here… I think I forgot how tiny they were. 
Seriously, my hand is bigger than the diaper!!

Granted my swollen hands are bigger than a lot of things these days so maybe that wasn’t the best bench mark, but still….what a tiny little bottom we’re going to be wiping soon!</description>

      <title>How My Son Decided We Should Celebrate Memorial Day</title>

      <description>I’ll be honest. When I think Memorial Day celebration, I typically think cook outs and swimming pools. This year being 9 mths preggo, we didn’t really make any big plans for Memorial Day weekend. Scott grilled for us several times and even got out this smoker and cooked a chicken for Monday’s dinner. We went to the park, did a few things around the house and basically took it easy all weekend.</description>

      <description>In honor of Memorial Day, I thought I’d repost this post from Jan of 09 in which my son first learned of the ultimate sacrifice many of our soldiers make for our country. As we were discussing what Memorial Day was this week, my son asked what we were going to do to celebrate. “So, are we going to the memorial in Annapolis then?” I realized that sadly, Memorial Day typically comes and goes without much thought at all to why we have the day off.</description>

      <description>Sometimes in the chaos of finding baseball gloves and missing cleats, in the midst of grocery shopping and read alouds, sometimes if your not careful, it is all too easy to miss the point. In the midst of doing so many good and important things, you can neglect to focus on the main purpose of it all. Irecently had a the opportunity to read and review the book One Million Arrows by Julie Ferwerda.</description>

      <description>I’ve already confessed quite a few of my fashion fashion fo paws for you here on the good ol blog. Why not add another to the list? (I’m really just secretly hoping that Stacy and Clinton will come whisk me away and give me a brand new ward robe to enjoy with my post baby body… ah, wouldn’t that be nice)…
But, back to reality…
I am afraid that perhaps I know where my daughter got her bold fashion sense from.</description>

 They fly so close you see the pilot!
 Scott says I have to point the crazy small distance between the wings of the first plane and the cockpit of the next – They do corkscrew loops in that formation!</description>

      <description>I love pictures. I’ll often find myself just staring at the screen saver on our laptop as the pictures scroll by. These two blasts from the pasts crack me up every time they pop onto the screen. They were taken on two totally different occasions, thought it appears my son was approximately the same age in both. It also appears that his red striped shirt was his bully apparel. Does he not look like the kid who would steal your lunch on the playground?</description>

      <description>Sometimes I watch my husband as he fathers my kids and he just takes my breath away. 
I love the way he can explain to my son in terms he can understand how just about anything under the sun works. I love the way he pulls the kids aside and talks to them about respecting their momma. I love when he takes one of them with him to church when he has deacon duty so they can have some special one on one time while he unlocks the church classrooms.</description>

      <description>After kissing my kids goodnight, singing them their lullaby, and closing the door, one of my favorite parts of the day is listening to my kids talk and giggle as they drift off into dreamland.
Having them so close together truly has been a blessing in so many ways. However, I have felt really guilty during the summers when I seemed to always have an infant in my arms and thus, my poor boy did not learn to swim.</description>

      <description>Last week at church they gave an advertisement for our upcoming Vacation Bible School. I was a few minutes late so I missed the announcement. When I sat down my son said, “I do not want to go to VBS this year!” I couldn’t figure out why. My son said, “It’s not going to be anything like last year… it’s an adventure camp.” Figuring he must have been intimidated by the adjectives they used to describe it, I told him it is going to be really fun.</description>

      <description>I had a dream last night that I accidentally opened the envelope and found out we were having a girl.
If your wondering how one can accidentally open the envelope, it’s actually not to hard to do b/c yesterday I was cleaning out some papers to be filed and saw a sealed blank envelope and thought, “What is that?” Thankfully, before opening it, I saw the name of the sonogram office in the corner and realized what it was.</description>

      <description>For the past 3 years the kids and I have gone to a local strawberry farm to pick our own berries. It is a tradition I cherish. 
We are suburbanites. We don’t even really garden. But, I love for my children to get some real life farm experiences. I love for them to walk down the rows upon rows of plants.

This year my son really went to town.</description>

      <description>In an attempt to make oral reading more fun, I gave my son the option of picking any location in our house to do his reading time.  He chose my closet.
Would not have been my first choice, but no worries, to the closet we went… I brought a pillow for me to sit on as the floor isn’t so comfy for this 9 mth pregnant momma. My son looked at me and said, “Hey, how come you aren’t sharing that pillow with me?</description>

      <description>By the third time around, one would think that a gal would have the whole labor thing down pat.
One would think….
About a week or so before my due date, I started having contractions…nothing super painful, but enough to make we wonder, “What if this ends up being it?” This time around the van was vacuumed well in advance, so no early morning trips to the gas station for Scott to clean the car before heading to the doctors.</description>

      <description>We had really good intentions, I swear.
We got the envelope in the mail and when it came, I remember Scott perusing it and saying, “We must mail this in soon. We can’t forget to do this.” And so I did what I do with all of our important papers and I put it on the counter so I wouldn’t lose it and so I’d know right where they were.</description>

      <description>My daughter sleeps with so many animals, pillows, dolls, and blankets in her bed, that sometimes when I go in to kiss her before I go to bed, I can’t find her. One night I thought I saw her and then realized I almost kissed her cabbage patch doll. Can you find her in the pile? It reminds me of the old Where’s Waldo books.
Here’s a closer look… there she is!</description>

      <description>This weekend I was reminded of how a little care and attention can make one feel loved and cherished. They lathered me with love as they enthusiastically rubbed my legs and feet with lotion.

Then my son found a battery powered fan and eagerly cooled me down when our power went out on Saturday afternoon. (seriously, was I living the high life or what?)

On Sunday they woke me up with breakfast in bed and flowers.</description>

      <description>22 months after we brought our son into the world, we eagerly welcomed his little sister.
I came home from a MOPS meeting a week before my due date noticing on and off contractions. I remember walking up the stairs and telling my husband I was having light contractions. I then burst into tears because we hadn’t yet vacuumed the car and I didn’t want to bring the baby home in a dirty car.</description>

      <description>Earlier, I alluded to the fact that my daughter finally got it after her first game of soccer. As the season has progressed, she has truly gotten it, indeed!
Here she is getting ready to steal the ball from the pack.
 Hmmm… notice a little blocking going on here?

And she goes in for the score!
 She did it! I love the look on her face after scoring another goal!</description>

Write it down folks. Circle it on your calendar. I’ve dreamed of this day for months. I’ve gotten so close only to be thwarted.
But, folks… it finally happened.
The circus family is caught up on laundry.
I know, I never thought it would happen either. Friday afternoon I washed my Christmas table cloth. This evening, I dry cleaned our sweaters with one of those handy Woolite Dry Cleaning sheets.</description>

      <description>Tonight I was reminded of the value of hard work. For the past two years I’ve had the joy of teaching my son’s beginning catechism class at our church on Sun evenings. The kids are working through the The Shorter Catechism Questions, and by completion of level 3 the kids will have memorized all 150 questions and answers. My son was in the beginning class which covers questions 1-32. Last year he came really close to getting them all, but we didn’t quite get them all.</description>

But, my own children are quite used to pregnancy. They get it more than most.</description>

but without a doubt, this one is my favorite.

His look truly says it all. Is that the face of a happy ball player or what?
This is what little league is all about…the pure love of the game. May he never outgrow it.

      <description>As the kids and I frolicked around the local farm park with friends the other day, I couldn’t help but smirk at my youngest in her “farm girl” attire.

As she eagerly peeked in on the baby piglets in with her dazzling shades and hot pink purse…

 She wrinkled her nose and said, “Mommy, something is stinky!”
 I couldn’t help but think of Za Za Gabor in Green Acres.</description>

      <description>Today I’d like to give a shout out to my maternal grandmother, whom I have lovingly called, “Mema” for as long as I can remember. I have this vivid picture in my mind of me in high school showing her and my Pap how to work our computer. I recall her being completely baffled by it and saying something to the effect of, “You’ll never catch me on that thing!” I remembered there being a picture of the event and when my parents were visiting last week I asked my mom if she knew where it was.</description>

      <description>In the interest of keeping it real, I’m going to tell you that I have not really been much for the whole green fad that has swept my generation. While we do recycle, that’s about the extent of it. Then a few years ago my pastor gave a sermon during a series on stewardship that hit home for me. He talked about the fact that while God did make the world for us to enjoy and inhabit, it didn’t mean he made it for us to squander and trash.</description>

      <description>10 years ago we came…spread a blanket out on the sandy shore to watch the sunset. Today we came, with sandwiches and Doritos. This time there was a picnic table where we had spread our blanket. And we watched the sunset mirrored in the faces of our three children.
 
10 years ago it was quiet… we held hands and sat close on the blanket.
Tonight there was sand in our shoes and children squirming….</description>

      <description>My daughter really is a very patient teacher’s assistant. She will sit quietly without ever saying a word and listen to her big brother as he sounds out the words to read the Bible story each night. It is quite precious.
And the other day I discovered that having her quiz him on flashcards is the perfect way to let her be involved in school. She happily sits and holds the cards up for him and will praise him when he gets the answers correct.</description>

      <description>As I’ve already made well aware, I am not exactly a fashion guru. You won’t find me flipping through the pages of Cosmopolitan in my free time. My nails are rarely done and my idea of styling my hair involves taking the time to blow dry rather than air dry.
I wanted to look cute when Scott and I went on a date a few weeks ago. I was so excited because my friend had just lent me some adorable maternity clothes so I didn’t really give my thought to my wardrobe till about 30 min before we were going to leave when I began to change.</description>

      <description>You know warm days are once again upon us, when you stumble across your bathroom sink looking like this. 
Probably had something to do with the hours my kids spent digging in the dirt in our backyard this afternoon.
 While they didn’t quite make it to China, they were thrilled to dig down to clay.  I love spring… even with the rings round my tub and the dirt deposits left in my sinks.</description>

      <description>6 years ago, I was also carrying a baby in my belly. (In fact, this picture was taken exactly 6 yrs ago to the date). The nursery was prepped, the hospital bag had long been packed. I was basically sitting around waiting to have a baby. I do not recommend going with that strategy… what a long week of waiting that was. Now I try to plan things right up to and past the due date, so I am not in that hurry up and wait mode.</description>

      <description>This weekend my daughter had her second soccer game and I am happy to report it went MUCH better than her first. No tears or pouting and lots of smiles and cute waves to Mom and Dad on the sidelines. She enthusiastically went after the ball and always cheerfully raised her hand to kick off or make the corner kick when they asked for volunteers. Like I said, a drastic improvement over game one.</description>

      <description>A few years ago a woman from my church passed out these prayer cards written by Bob Hostetler to the ladies in our MOPS group. Each card had 31 Biblical Virtues to pray for your children, with verses included. I thought this was a great idea and instantly tucked it away inside my Bible.
Only to forget about it and lose track of it with all the other papers stuffed in there.</description>

      <description>I went in to wake my daughter from nap time today and found her like this. 
I’m not sure if she fell asleep while playing or if she was just doing all she could to keep herself from falling asleep. Either way, looks rather uncomfortable to me.
Then there’s her sister.
We looked down during a soccer game a few weeks ago and found her like this.
Yes, that would be my youngest asleep ON the soccer field, during a game.</description>

      <description>Dear Sweet Baby of Mine,
Every time I sit down or lay down I can feel you move around inside of me. You are more active than any of your sisters or brother were in the womb. Perhaps you are trying to tell us already that you are eager to jump in and join in the chaos and fun that is our family. The feeling of you turning over or kicking and punching my sides…it’s almost as if you are saying, “Hey Mom!</description>

      <description>This weekend was full of family fun and excitement! Saturday morning the kids went to the neighborhood egg hunt with both sets of grandparents, while Scott and I went to a wedding reception.

The kids had a blast finding eggs and getting their faces painted. 
(some enjoyed the face paint more than others)
That evening (after my son and I got back from a trip to the the after hours clinic where he was diagnosed with pneumonia), we gathered the grands again to dye Easter eggs with us!</description>

      <description>Since before each of my children were born, my hearts deepest desire has been for them to know the Lord Jesus as their Savior. My son has demonstrated to us numerous times through various conversations that he recognizes he is a sinner and Christ died on the cross to forgive his sins.  My girls have not come to that point yet, but this Easter season we got one step closer.</description>

      <description>When it comes to books and movies, one favorite category of mine is crime drama. If the back cover mentions CIA, FBI, or any other government agency, you can bet I’d give it a try. I was quite excited when I had the opportunity to read an advanced copy of [Lis Wiehl’s](http://www.liswiehlbooks.com/ .) book Hand of Fate and review it on my blog. The book centers on 3 friends, (one a crime reporter, one a federal prosecutor, and the other an FBI agent) as they work together to solve the death of radio talk show personality, Jim Fate.</description>

      <description>I can’t explain it, but there is some innate, motherly, compulsion,need, desire to force my kids to pose nicely in their Easter clothes. More often than not, this event results in a very patient dad who kindly obliges his wife and tortures his kids, 3 restless and bored children and ultimately a disappointed mom who is stuck with 30 pictures of her kids in their clothes, and yet not one where they are all smiling.</description>

      <description>It’s been ** 2 ** years since I began writing “Life At The Circus.”
** 2 ** years and 654 posts
2 years, can you believe it? I can’t.
When I look back at my first posts, I laugh at how much my life has changed… and how much it hasn’t. It’s the end of the month and I gotta tell you, my fridge looks pretty much exactly the same as it did here two years ago.</description>

      <description>On Friday night we took advantage of the aquarium’s last discount priced Friday night of the season and enjoyed some family fun.

We took 293 pictures during our 3 hours at the aquarium. From those we narrowed down 42 keepers. 
And from those, I have the difficult task of dwindling down some for the blog. 
The kids favorite part of the evening was the dolphin show.</description>

      <description>Ever since my son dawned his shin guards and cleats for the first time, his little sister has been eagerly awaiting her opportunity. She’s watched longingly from the sidelines, eagerly taking the field during half time, yearning for her chance to tear up the field. Last fall during his practices, she would call me coach and ask me to assign her drills. I’d have her dribble the ball up and down the field, shooting under a bench as her imaginary goal.</description>

Unfortunatly, his gun kinda gives him away.
When I showed this picture to my husband I said it should be called,</description>

Scott and I have gone camping every year since we’ve been married, with the exception of one… the year 2004…when our first child was born.</description>

      <description>Ever tried to pack cupcakes in a lunch box? It creates a gooey mess all over the sandwich baggie and takes all the fun out of eating it when your hands are covered in icing. I saw this handy little trick in one of my student’s lunches back in my teaching days. Take your plain cupcake.

Slice it in half.

Take a glob of icing.
 Spread it in the middle of the cupcake.</description>

      <description>As we were walking out the door this morning, I heard my daughter exclaim, “Oh it’s raining, better grab my umbrella!” 
I wondered what she was talking about since we don’t have any umbrellas in our house. (Who needs one more thing to juggle? We just get wet, it’s the circus way)! Then I saw her walking to the car with her Little People umbrella over her head. She then carried this umbrella over her head into and out of the grocery store.</description>

      <description>The other day after quiet time my oldest emerged from his room with his first book. I knew nothing of his project until he emerged but was blown away by what he produced. On the cover page his listed himself as the “osr” and “iliusha” (author and illustrator). For his first book, he pretty much spells out the gospel message in word and pictures.
Page One: “God loved us” (I must say the spelling on this one def made me chuckle).</description>

But we like to be surprised. (of find some strange joy in self-torture)

      <description>The other day my son told me he wanted to make all of us breakfast the next morning. The only problem with this very sweet gesture was that it was the end of the month and we were at the “creative” stage of the month/meal plan.
Bread? No
Milk? No
Cereal? No
Not much available for a 5 yr old to fix, so I convinced him to wait till after I went grocery shopping on Monday.</description>

      <description>“You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both and there you have The Facts of Life, the Facts of Life.”
Blogging is funny, as many of you bloggers know, because when you write a post, you’re really writing a snapshot of a moment in time. And as as the author (or photographer, if you will) you get to choose which moment in time you post and thus you can largely shape the perception of your self and your family life that you present to the world.</description>

      <description>Guess what the kids and I spotted outside this afternoon?  Crocuses!!! Oh, how I love those little purple blooms… they are the signal to me that spring is around the corner! And as much as I have loved, (and truly, I know I whined that one day, but really, I have loved this record breaking snowy winter), but I am excited for spring.
And I am really excited… I am looking forward to taking walks with the kids in the evenings.</description>

      <description>My girls, especially my youngest, love to change clothes. And often. It borders on ridiculous. I knew if I didn’t document it, no one would believe me.
So, take a look at Thursdays attire here at the circus. (I will mention that we never left the house today). The day started at 7:00am, didn’t have the camera ready then, but here she is at 8:30am. (wearing the clothes she wore last night plus a coat)</description>

      <description>I love Christmas. One of the things I love most is that it is celebrated for an entire month. I love the time of preparation and the focus on Christ’s birth.
But without Easter, Christmas truly is meaningless. As awesome as it is that God sent his only Son to earth, it is only the first part of the story. His death on the cross for our sins and the fact that he rose from the dead 3 days later is what gives not just this story, but every life story purpose and meaning.</description>

      <description>I know that many think Valentine’s day is just a day created by Hallmark. Others think it’s a cheesy holiday for saps. Say what you will, I’ll jump at a chance for a date night with my hubby. And I don’t mind a sweet card and some cinnamon heart candy either.
But, after having kids, Scott and I found it rather difficult to go out for Valentine’s day. Since we don’t hire babysitters, we typically rely on friends or grandparents for babysitting and you can’t ask another couple to babysit for you on Valentine’s Day.</description>

      <description>When I came out to the kitchen to make breakfast this morning, I felt a cold draft. I then noticed my son sitting in the sliding glass door. 
He told me he was listening to the birds in the backyard. They were offering up a beautiful melody. One thing I love about life with small children is that they help you to stop and take notice of the everyday miracles in the world around you.</description>

      <description>Thought I’d share a glimpse of our dishwasher with you all. Because it cracks me up. Last week I called Scott at work to tell him the dishwasher was gushing water out the sides. One thing I love about Scott, is that when something appears broken, he almost always finds a way to make it work. Seriously, he is not afraid to tear anything apart and “macgyver” it. Which has saved us tons of money over the years… He’s torn apart computers, the washing machine, the dishwasher, our oven, the toilet…</description>

      <description>We knew this day was coming for awhile now. In fact, it got pushed back at least twice. But, sadly, the inevitable could not be avoided…after spending 10 weeks on the east coast, aunt Karen and baby Eli headed back to Texas this morning. We have had a blast having them close for so long. It’s been so fun to “pretend” they were local and see them casually for dinners, or at church, or for an overnight every now and then.</description>

      <description>Thought you might enjoy a little simple math to recap the week here at the circus. Add together the following totals….
 2 major snowstorms 33 inches of snow fallen 1 official blizzard  
 20 cups of hot chocolate drank 2 types of cookies baked  
 1 Daddy sized igloo built  
 1 sledding hill      0 power outages
 1 sleepover with our cousin</description>

      <description>Took the kids for a walk to the park. Nothing exceptional about that, except I realized when looking through pictures that exactly 2 years before I had done the same thing.
We were compelled to go because of the exceptional weather.
Funny how life repeats itself.
Only it doesn’t.
2 years ago, we didn’t wear jackets.  
 In fact, if you look close… some of us weren’t even wearing shoes.</description>

      <description>If your from the midatlantic region (as most of my readers are, b/c I think most of my readers stalk me from facebook) then you have probably seen and read and heard all you want about snow this past week. Seriously, I have scrolled through and looked at gazillions of pictures of face book friends back decks overflowing with snow and seen kids waste high in it, which is kind of funny since I can look out my own windows and see the very same images.</description>

      <description>Mary has created a carnival to help us record those funny and precious things our kids say, so we’ll remember them in years to come. Some weeks I’ve got nothing…this week, however, my kids gave me a few gems I don’t want to forget.  Last week my five year old and I were working on handwriting.&amp;amp;#160; Handwriting is often a battlefield for us.&amp;amp;#160; This particular day I knew he wasn’t giving it his all and I wasn’t seeing his best work.</description>

      <description>Most years when I put together our family scrapbooks, our “Fun in the Snow” spread looks something like this. Notice the grass poking through the snow and the pathetic little snowball snowman my son built?
But, this winter has been crazy! We had a record breaking snowfall in December. Then, last week we got a good 6 inches of snowfall (which in any normal MD winter, would have made us giddy with excitement).</description>

      <description>Last night I was holding my girls on my lap when they began to play a little rough. I reminded them that there was a baby in my belly and they needed to be gentle. My 4 yr old then said, “Mom, I don’t think you really have a baby in your belly. I think it is just food.”
I assured her there really is a baby in there and reminded her that she’s seen the baby’s picture and heard the heart beat.</description>

She was quite excited to pose for me afterwards.
 Doesn’t she look so grown up? Seriously, when did this happen?

      <description>In Science we’ve been talking about what God created on each of the 6 days of creation. Currently we’re on day 6 and discussing the creatures that walked on the land. While the kids were playing on Friday, they got the idea to group their stuffed animals according to classification. Of course they didn’t use these exact words. But, they made a pile of non mammals and another of mammals and then called me in to take a look.</description>

      <description>February is here. I am happy to say I’ve finally put away all our Christmas decor and while it isn’t completely conquered, I have tamed the laundry beast and gotten somewhat of a grip on the house chores and school work. For now
So, with this new month, I’ve set some goals for some things I’d like to get done around the house. And thanks to two different blogging friends, I have some accountability and inspiration.</description>

      <description>My oldest two have gotten into the habit of “e-mailing” each other at the beginning of nap time. And by e-mailing they really mean they are drawing pictures and writing messages back and forth to each other. We’ve worked out a system in which they are allowed to e-mail for the first 30 minutes of nap time. Then, they have to have quiet time in separate rooms for the remaining hour and a half.</description>

      <description>One thing my husband and I try to stress to our kids is that life is not all about them. We love them dearly, and pour much of our time, love, energy and attention out onto them. But, because we love them, we also try to teach them that life does not revolve around them.
We are a family of 5 soon to be 6. So, in a lot of ways this is a lesson that is taught early on out of practicality.</description>

      <description>January has been hard for me. We have our Christmas decorations down, but still not put away. There is a underlying sense of clutter and chaos lurking around the circus, rather than the clean slate, fresh start of a new year. I long for a good, deep clean to get things in order, top to bottom and help me to feel on top of things once again. But, it seems each day I am pulled by the more immediate needs of the day… sick kids… volunteering at school, entertaining guests, New Years cards (never got to the Christmas cards, did print New Years cards and really wanted them mailed before Feb), and school work.</description>

      <description>Sometimes the music in my car radio really serves as nothing more than background noise to the chattering or squabbling going on in the back seat and the to do lists and other random thoughts going on in my brain. One day though something about the lyrics caused me to take pause and listen. I turned the radio up and even though I’ve heard the song countless times before, I listened to it for the first time.</description>

      <description>This morning I woke to sounds of my daughter coughing…I stumbled into her room to comfort her and set up her nebulizer, thinking to myself that at least I had gotten 2 hours of uninterrupted sleep. Then my eyes focused a bit more and I took a second look at the clock. It was 6:15, not 1:15!
We slept through the night! I felt much like a new mom the morning after her baby makes it all night without a feeling!</description>

      <description>Our little girl really is super girl and she proved it last night. She is crazy tough. So let me cut to the chase and say that her injury was pretty bad. The need for stitches was obvious but even the doctor had not realized at first that it was so deep it would require both internal and external stitches. My girl had been cut deep. The coffee table/toy box had cut all the way to the bone.</description>

      <description>Tonight is one of those nights when I am extra thankful that God has given me a helpmate in life. And not just any helpmate, but one of the best.
My three year old was getting on the couch this evening, and if you know my girls, you know that they do this with much exuberance, so somewhere during the twirl she slipped and fell back, hitting her head on our toy box/coffee table.</description>

      <description>Last night I finally got around to updating my circus cast page….it was LONG overdue and quite outdated, not to mention incorrectly formatted! Take a minute and let me know what you think of the changes! I had my youngest as the mime b/c when I first created the page, she wasn’t yet speaking. I am considering making number 4 my mime instead, but don’t know what circus role to give to my third child.</description>

      <description>BABY!!!!!

This morning we had our sonogram appointment. While it is our fourth pregnancy, I try as hard as I can to not take anything for granted. I don’t think I realized how much I was “holding my breath” so to speak before the appointment. Words can’t adequately express the feelings of thanksgiving that overwhelmed me when the tech and then the doctor told us that everything looked healthy and normal.</description>

      <description>This year we celebrated New Years in two parts. We did a family fun night with the kids concluding at 8 with followed by a date night with the two of us to officially ring in the new year. 
Here are some pictures of my son cutting it up on the impromptu dance floor in our living room. He was having a blast, as I am sure you can tell.</description>

      <description>Vacation was wonderful.
Honestly, it was more of a “staycation” and stay and cation I did.
Scott redid all the plumbing in our house this past week. He also used his new Christmas gift-a smoker to make us dinner twice. 
I, on the other hand, staycationed.
And as I surveyed the house this morning, boy did it show.
With Scott plumbing all week, I actually had a reasonable excuse for my laundry neglect.</description>

      <description>I was so excited at the end of the year when I checked my earnings report from Amazon. Since my last update on Nov 8th, we earned $89.32 more!

Thanks to all of you who clicked through my site first when doing your Christmas shopping at Amazon this season. I was so excited to make a donation to World Vision’s Sudan Food and Care fund for $180! Combined with the previous earnings, we have worked together to send ** $280 ** to aid the refugees in Sudan.</description>

      <description>As 2009 came to a close, we spent some time as a family discussing the highlights. It really was a wonderful year! I feel so blessed for the many opportunities for family fun that we had in the past year.
 In January Scott and I were able to go to a Steelers home AFC championship and watch them beat the Ravens and make it to the Super bowl. Shortly after we hosted a Super bowl party with our family and watched our beloved Steelers bring home a 6th Super bowl victory.</description>

      <description>As I was looking over the pictures we took on Christmas Day in order to make my collage, I commented to Scott that it appears I wasn’t there for Christmas morning as I couldn’t find any shots with me in them. Then I realized I was wrong as I spotted this picture.

Whew…. good thing I was wrong… there is photographic evidence of my existence at Christmas 2009. :-)</description>

      <description>One of my favorite things we did this Christmas was take the kids shopping for each other and for us. It is heartwarming to see them get so excited about giving. I also loved seeing what they picked out for others. My son is an excellent gift giver. He is very thoughtful and thinks very hard about finding a gift the person will truly like. I just had to share the story Scott told me about taking him shopping for my gift.</description>

      <description>We have had a wonderful couple of days here at the circus celebrating Jesus’ birthday. We decided to spread the celebrating out over several days rather than cram it all into one day. On Christmas Eve we went to the Children’s service at our church at 4:30. Then we went to Boston Market for our now traditional Christmas Eve dinner before heading back to church for the candlelight service at 6:30.</description>

      <description>Only 2 days till Christmas and my to do list today looks like this.
 Clean bathroom- scrub toilet, scrub sink, scrub tub and tile (I write each individually so I can feel more satisfaction when I am done by crossing off 4 things instead of one) Clean guestroom- My parents always say, don’t worry or stress about cleaning up for them. And I appreciate the fact that I can keep things real and not stress out, but… I think I need to clear off a place for them to sleep, don’t you?</description>

      <description>Let it Snow, Let it Snow, Let it Snow!!!
Growing up and living in the midAtlantic region means that snow is something we are familiar with, but we don’t encounter on a regular basis. It’s not like we’re living in Houston and a dusting of snow occurs once a decade. But, it also isn’t unreasonable that I don’t go out and purchase snow suits for my kids every winter either. We can typically anticipate seeing snowfall at least once a year.</description>

      <description>As many of you with more than one child know, it’s often hard to find one on one time with your children. I’ve found you really have to be intentional, in order for it to happen. I’ve also found that it doesn’t always have to be a big elaborate event. Often it is just taking advantage of the few minutes of snuggle time when one child wakes up first in the morning, or after nap time.</description>

As we were getting ready to go to the tree lighting ceremony downtown my son asked, “Mom, can I tell Santa that he is not what Christmas is all about?”
I love that as we anticipate Christmas, my kids know that we are preparing to celebrate Jesus’ birth.</description>

      <description>This year, I was looking for something simple and inexpensive that the kids could work together with me to make for their teachers. Too much to ask? I hoped not, but nothing was coming to me. And then I remembered this brittle that someone had brought to MOPS a few years ago. It uses saltine crackers. And you can pick up a box of Saltines at Aldi’s for 89 cents… which is perfect since I have to make gifts for SS and Bible Study teachers (times 3) plus neighbors and the tutorial teacher and “don’t forget my gymnastic teacher Mom!</description>

  Thankfully, it wasn’t butter to be spread on bread, but instead I am hoping to bake some cookies this afternoon.</description>

*I recently made the wonderful discovery of sharp Monterey Jack cheese. I’ve seen it mixed with cheddar in bags at the store, and knew you could put it in tacos or what not.</description>

      <description>Last week we were at my parents house and my son came into the kitchen quite exasperated from going to the bathroom.
“Mom,” he complained, “can you puh-leeze tell the girls to put the seat up when they are done going potty? They keep leaving it down!”
I had to laugh. Women have complained for years about men leaving the seat up, but never, never have I heard a complaint about us leaving it down.</description>

Pure genius, I tell you.
We were sitting around the table the other day at dinner. Nothing out of the ordinary. The kids were complaining about eating their green beans. Like I said, nothing unusual.
Then Scott asked my son, “Do you know why parents raise kids?”
“Because their fast.”
Pause…Confusion…
“No, not race, raise, as in, why do they have kids and help them grow up?</description>

Gloves?

Check.
Tree cart?

Check.
Now to find the perfect tree.
“How about this one I suggest?”
“No, that looks like an angel tree,” my son says. “We need to find a star tree.”
My son doesn’t like when there are too many branches on the bottom as they are harder to cut down. (We always pick spruces and they are quite painful and prickly).</description>

      <description>This year the Thanksgiving menu held some old favs and some new favs as well. Thought I’d share the recipes so you could stick em in your box for next year, or for later this holiday season.
My mom’s apple pie is by far my most favorite apple pie in the world. In fact, I am an apple pie snob and won’t eat any other pie but her recipe. Because, once you’ve had this one, no others compare in my opinion.</description>

Today we made turkey cookies thanks to this post I read last night. Rule number 1, don’t look to close at the example picture here, just quickly look at it to get the idea, then close it. Otherwise, these won’t seem exactly up to snuff. But, we had a blast decorating them and they taste yummy, so who cares if they aren’t picture perfect?</description>

      <description>I was feeling pretty good about myself this week. Got a little boost of energy with week 12 and began to tame this household which I had slacked off on over the first trimester. Finally, I can leave the guest bedroom door open as well as the master bed room. I even cleaned out the van which had reached its height of total messiness, threw away all that trash crammed in around the car seats and brought in the plethora of coats and shoes which were strewn all over the floor.</description>

      <description>When my son started preschool last fall, I told him he’d have a chance to make some new friends. His response? “I don’t need new friends. I have enough friends already.” I then proceeded to explain that sometimes maybe they need us. It took a little while, but he warmed up and made some new friends at preschool.
Hmmm… ever notice how sometimes you see something about yourself reflected in your child?</description>

      <description>The first time Scott went away on business travel, we were newly married and when he told me he was going to CA for a week, I really thought the world was ending. Looking back it was one of those classic examples of a couple looking at the same event in two different ways. For Scott the trip was an exciting opportunity. A chance to do something new and definitely a plus for his career.</description>

      <description>1. Two rakes and three kids does not make for a happy equation. 2. Make sure your kids have their shoes securely tied before you begin raking. Otherwise you could rake a pile like this only to have your son tell you it was time to go on a “treasure hunt” to find his missing shoes in said pile.
3. If your going to jump into the pile with the kids, don’t wear baggy jeans.</description>

      <description>During this stage of the game, sometimes it’s easy to forget there’s a person growing inside me. Yes, my jeans are fitting more snugly these days and I tend to nod off on the couch each night around 10, but other than that I don’t feel all the different. And so I go through each day making meals, cleaning up messes, and trying to accomplish lessons, errands, and other excursions and quite often forget that all the while there’s a life growing inside of me.</description>

      <description>One of my favorite parts about home schooling has been the field trips. We have tutorial sessions on Mon and Wed. Tues we have school at home and typically it is a catch up day for me around the house. I try to keep Tuesdays open as I need that day to just be at home. Thursdays we have school at home, plus BSF in the morning, and often a play date over lunch.</description>

      <description>This year in my Bible Study we are studying the book of John. Last week we read in John 4 about the Samaritan woman at the well. It’s funny to me how I can read a passage I’ve heard many times before and this time see it in a new light with fresh application. I love how living and breathing the Word of God is. Many things challenged me about this passage.</description>

      <description>It appears my oldest daughter is trying to prepare me for life with 4 kids. She has taken on the job of mothering her baby doll “baby Eli” literally 24-7. When we sit down to eat, she makes sure Eli has his bib on and a special seat at the table. We now set our table for 7 (b/c our youngest has to include her baby Eli too). 
When she’s getting ready for bed, baby Eli also gets tucked into his bed, with his own baby and she is always certain to read him his special Bible story as well.</description>

      <description>For all of you who have bought something from Amazon and done so by clicking through my site, congratulate yourselves. I checked my Amazon affiliate account today and I have earned $50.00 thus far! As you may remember, Scott and I decided to match whatever money it earns (up to the first $200), so tonight I wrote a check to World Vision’s Sudan Relief Fund for $100! Whoohooo!  I know I just got through telling you that I don’t want to rush the Thanksgiving season, by thinking of Christmas.</description>

      <description>Long before the costumes and candy were even consumed for Halloween, stores already had their Christmas products on the shelves. I saw Santa and Jack-o-lanterns literally across the aisle from each other at Target a few weeks ago. And now, while the candy still lingers in our pumpkin bowls, if you walk into any department store, mall, or craft store, you’d swear it was December as the sights, sounds, and smells all tell of Christmas.</description>

      <description>OK, so Halloween was 6 days ago, and I gotta tell you this circus mom has had more than her fair share of the loot. The kids are doing quite well with an occasional piece after a meal here or there. Mom on the other hand seems to go for the candy bowl come nap and bed time and she rarely stops with one. The other morning when the kids came out to the living room my son spotted a few candy wrappers sitting on the couch.</description>

      <description>Remember my confession back in May about my hefty library charge? I am happy to report that I’ve actually gotten much better about returning library books since then. And no, it’s not because I’ve stopped going to the library. Sure, I’ve paid an occasional fee here or there, but nothing close to the $42.09 I paid back in May. Perhaps they won’t be naming the local branch after the circus family after all.</description>

      <description>Those of you that have been visiting the circus for awhile know that I don’t use my kids names on the blogs. I once entertained the idea of pseudonyms but never came up with any I liked. So I’ve pretty much stuck with “ my son,” “my 3 year old daughter” and “my baby” for the past year or so. So far, I have no real intentions to change that, but I did realize last week, that had this been “Life with The Peanuts Gang” or something more catchy, I’d have perfect pseudonyms to use.</description>

      <description>This weekend the kids got to meet their newest cousin, “baby Ewi.” They were all quite excited to finally make his acquaintance. The girls have been carrying their dolls around for weeks now feeding, rocking, and putting to sleep their very own “baby Ewi’s.” But my middle child was probably the most smitten, to say the least. She could quite often be found by his side, smiling at him, tickling him and laughing at every noise he made.</description>

      <description>Gentleman. I am convinced that if you were to look the word up in the dictionary, you’d have to find a picture of this man.  I first met him at our high school graduation. I remember being taken with the fact that he had one of those sweaters with the reinforced elbows and remarked to Scott how much I loved his genuine “Grandpa sweater” and was convinced he’d be the perfect Worthers Original grandpa.</description>

      <description>At dinner last night I was telling Scott how cute it is to watch our 3 yr old in gymnastics. Every now and then she’ll look at the observation window, get a big grin and wave to me. Sometimes she’ll even give me a thumbs up sign. At which point she chimed in and said,
“Yea, this means good.”

“And this means Ravens”

What can I say? That’s my girl!</description>

      <description>I’ve been putting it off for far too long (as you can soon tell by my before picture). But today I decided that my poor girl was past due for a hair cut. We’ve cut her bangs, but nothing major since what I refer to as the “debacle of 07” when I took my sweet 22 mth old for a hair cut and returned with a sweet little girl sporting the bowl cut.</description>

      <description>In the past month, these pictures were taken during meal time at our home. I can assure you that these antics don’t take place regularly around here, but at the same time, they do happen. After all, it is the circus.
Exhibit A: playing with our food

“Look Mom, I can make vowels with my spaghetti!”

Exhibit B:  Yes, that would be my son eating his applesauce while sitting on his Daddy’s shoulders (and yes, to make it truly circus like, he’s in his underwear).</description>

      <description>The concept of time is a funny thing. Who can really grasp it? On one hand it seems like ages ago that I brought my little one home from the hospital, and at the same time it feels just like yesterday. How does one go about teaching the concept of time to little ones? To them a day truly is like a thousand years! I read somewhere that its helpful to give children a specific time (as in you have 10 minutes to play and then we are cleaning up) then set the timer and when the timer goes off, clean up.</description>

I also love how the big kids seem to be attacking him b/c he’s got the youngest on his shoulders. Almost as if they are trying to get in on the action and attention. But take a closer look, because if you check out Scott’s face, you’ll find another gem.</description>

      <description>Well, I am about one month into my homeschooling experience and thought I’d reflect on it.
I love it!
You know I waffled and prayed and struggled with the decision. It wasn’t like I knew from the minute I brought him home from the hospital that I’d be a home schooling mom. As I prepped our “classroom” I was still clinging to the fact that at any moment I could change my mind and enroll him at the local public school.</description>

      <description>Here’s my daughter sleeping in her crib at 8 months old.
 And here she is at 14 mths old. Still enjoys sleeping “folded in half”, as we refer to it.
 
Earlier this week when my husband went in to kiss the kids goodnight, he found her at 3 and 1/2 sleeping in the very same position she favored as an infant.  I would think with age this position would grow more impossible and uncomfortable.</description>

      <description>I seriously stink at parking. (Not parallel parking. I’ve got a secret for that. I never do it. Ever. Yes, I will walk twice as far when parking downtown to avoid parallel parking on the street). But, my struggle is with the ol’ pull in parking lots. More specifically, backing out of said spots. I’ve been known to wait around in my car for the car beside me or in front of me to leave so I can get out of my spot b/c I parked too close to the line and can’t get out without damaging one of our cars.</description>

      <description>I am afraid I don’t have much for you this weekend in terms of deep thoughts. But I did stumble across this passage of Scripture. Doesn’t it make a wonderful prayer for us to offer up to our Lord? I am particularly challenged by verse 36. Oh, that I would turn my heart towards God’s statues rather than my own selfish gains. Teach me Oh God. Psalm 119:33-36
_ 33 Teach me, O LORD, to follow your decrees; then I will keep them to the end.</description>

      <description>Its funny to me how many “old sayings” run through my head on any given day.
For example, “Don’t cry over spilled milk.” I must repeat that to myself at least twice a week&amp;hellip; “Don’t cry over spilled milk… DON’T CRY over spilled milk… (and in my head I also add quite often, don’t make anyone else cry over spilled milk.”
So, I had to laugh when my son and I were doing science this afternoon and we were talking about the various states of water.</description>

      <description>I come from a long line of crafty and artistically talented people. I am not one of them.
But, I do ok with basic elementary arts and crafts. I even considered them my forte. Until this week.
I was quite excited to do some apple stamping with the kids after our trip to the orchard last week. I’ve never done it, but wanted to for awhile. This seemed like the perfect time… last week we did the short a sound in phonics, went to the orchard on Friday, so this seemed perfect for art on Tuesday.</description>

      <description>Every now and then at the circus, I find myself enjoying a moment of peace. All too often that peace and quiet is the result of complete and massive destruction going on quietly in another room of the house… say an overflowing sink, or crayon art on the wall, or something else which seems to bind my children in complete quiet. But sometimes, sometimes all is calm and when I fearfully peek around the corner, I catch a moment like this.</description>

      <description>Last night I came home from Kids Quest (our church’s evening class for kids in which we teach them the questions from the Shorter Catechism), pizza in hand and Scott and I quickly tag teamed to get the kids in bed so we could hit play and watch the recorded Steelers game. (I seriously think the invention of the DVR has got to go on my top 5 list of inventions that changed my life… I LOVE it)!</description>

      <description>In my last weekend thought post, I mentioned my desire to teach my children to live their life in full and not let fear keep them from enjoying life’s pleasures. Ironically enough a week later I found myself having to choose between sitting on the sidelines or facing my fear.

15 years ago I got on a Gerris wheel with my friends. It seemed harmless enough at the time. But the combination of the height and the swaying car sent me into a full fledge panic.</description>

      <description>One Sunday I picked my 2 year old son up from Sunday School and found goldfish in his bin. He had saved some of his snack to share with Mommy and Daddy. My jaw hit the floor. His thoughtfulness both touched and humbled me.
Our church has a fellowship time between services in which you can have some cookies, popcorn, coffee, and lemonade. Once my son was old enough to attend church with us after Sunday School, he got to come join us for the fellowship time as well.</description>

      <description>As I’ve returned to the classroom these past few weeks (though in a very different atmosphere), I can’t help but reflect on my years of teaching prior to becoming a stay at home mom. I was blessed to teach for 3 years at a small, Christian school. I learned a lot and grew from the experience. I honestly think it shaped the way I parent today.
That being said, I can’t help but reflect on the single.</description>

Cotton Candy
 
And a visit with Spiderman himself

So, what’s your favorite part of the fair? The animals, the rides, the food, or the super heroes?

      <description>Every fall, since my first born was only 5 months old, I’ve taken my children to the county fair. We don’t by any stretch live in a rural area, so I am sure some of you country folk would laugh and heckle what we call a county fair. But, for my suburbanite children and I, it offers a rare opportunity to see some farm animals up close. It is a fall tradition we look forward to all summer long!</description>

      <description>I’m sorry. Really I am. I had every intention of posting a thought this weekend and here it is Sunday night and I haven’t posted since Thursday!! Last week was my first week back into the real world. For the past 5 years I for the most part lived without an alarm. I’d wake when the kids woke, and our day would begin, sloooooowly after that. Now that we’re in Kindergarten I’m up at 6 and getting the circus crew fed, dressed and ready to start the day by 8 am.</description>

      <description>In the interest of keeping it real and not pretending to be something I am not, I feel the need to come clean.
Remember how excited I was when my 2 year old was wearing underwear at her 2nd birthday?
Yea, I believe I received many a pat on the back and comments of “You’ll have to come potty train my kid.”
Well, I must come clean and say for the past few weeks she has totally regressed.</description>

      <description>After months of deliberating, praying, waiting, and a little second guessing, the first day of school finally arrived this week. As you may recall we decided to home school, but with a twist. We’ve enrolled our son in a home school tutorial that he attends two days a week. So he has school at home with me three days a week, and at his tutorial 2 days a week. In a lot of ways, it’s the best of both worlds.</description>

      <description>**** Updated with new quote from this very afternoon****
One of my favorite parts of motherhood, is watching my children grow and develop. As they get older it is so much fun to see their individuality and personality emerge. This week marked some big milestones in the circus family life. On Sunday, for the first time in 5 years, I didn’t drop any of my children off in the nursery for church.</description>

      <description>My children have been inundated with Chick-Fil-A from birth. The first thing I ate after my daughter’s delivery was a CFA sandwich. I have scrapbook pages in each of my daughter’s first year scrapbooks, dedicated to their first Kids Meals at Chick-Fil-A. The first logo/graphic my son recognized was for Chick-Fil-A. Anytime he saw a cursive C when he was a toddler, he thought it was the word Chick-Fil-A. They’ve known and loved the Chick-Fil-A cow since they were babies and we’ve even dressed like one for the past 5 years.</description>

      <description>My child has been permanently scarred by a helium balloon.
I’m sure you think that I am kidding or exaggerating, but I promise you I am not. Remember this? Well two months after that traumatic experience, Scott took the kids to buy a balloon for my birthday, and needless to say my son (being the oldest child, and the overly cautious one that he is), was very nervous about the balloon flying away.</description>

      <description>I love my husband’s Nana. She’s a remarkable lady. I loved her for years, just based on hearing about her from her grandson and reading her sweet letters. Then, I flew to California and met her. And I loved her as my own Nana!! When I walked in her side door, I instantly felt at home. I sat down at her table and never wanted to leave again.
Gana (as my kids call her b/c she is their Great Nana) is famous for her quince jam, her tacos, and her French toast (among many other things).</description>

      <description>&amp;quot;It takes a long time to grow an old friend.&amp;quot; - by John Leonard

Nothing says labor day weekend to me, then a house bursting at the seams with friends. For the past 8 years, we’ve spent labor day with my group of 6 best friends from high school and our growing families. While we’ve changed locations over the years from rustic accommodations, rental homes, and friends houses, some things have remained constant.</description>

      <description>Last week I survived the Annapolis 10 Mile Run. I’d like to say that I raced it or ran it, but in actuality I just survived it.
While one might wonder why I am not more excited and proud of such an accomplishment, it is because the year prior, I ran it well. I trained for it all summer and come race day I did my best. Now my best is only about 15 min faster than my survival pace, but the feeling I had when crossing the finish line was worlds different.</description>

      <description>I realized recently, that while I spend lots of time with my kids, too often it&amp;rsquo;s easy for me to spend the day with them, without really playing with them. So, these past few weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a lot more playing. And I gotta say, I&amp;rsquo;m loving it.
One hit with the circus crew recently has been beauty shop. To make it an equal opportunity for all, I did a little hair spiking for my son.</description>

      <description>After spending many hours on the sidelines watching her big brother play soccer or baseball, today my middle child had a chance to shine in a sport of her own…
GYMNASTICS

And my fearless and flexible tumbler, LOVED it, much like I anticipated she would. 
She told me at the end of class, “Mommy, I’m a gymnast!”

To commemorate it’s end, I thought I’d share a few of my favorite things about summer here at the circus. So here they are…in no particular order…

      <description>I once read or heard somewhere that kids need to draw in spaces bigger than 8x11 sheets of paper.
I tucked that little nugget of info away and to be honest did absolutely nothing with it, till last week.

During one of our 3 sick days last week, I looked down at a brown bag and got inspiration!!
 
I cut the bag open much like you do when making book covers and gave each kid one half of a brown bag to draw on.</description>

      <description>Have you ever experienced complete darkness? I’m not talking about shutting out the lights before you crawl under the covers, but total darkness. In our electronic world of LEDs, it’s something we don’t often experience. During our time exploring Carlsbad earlier this week, the ranger brought us into a cavern 830 feet below the earth and shut off the lights. No flash lights. No matches. No floor lights. Nothing.
It was dark.</description>

      <description>Well, the local public schools went back in session at the beginning of the week and even though we are homeschooling this year, we’ve already got sick germs at the circus. Seems we’re not holding out for long sleeves and sweaters to welcome in those lovely, little germs.
But, can I tell you a little secret?
Part of me likes sick days.
No, I don’t like to see my kids suffering, and no I am not a big fan of the whining or continual moaning.</description>

      <description>Here’s a random Crystal factoid for you.
I hate flying.
It not the getting to the airport hrs early or the waiting in lines for security that gets me. It&amp;rsquo;s the act of actually flying that I am opposed to. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong. I do it and though I am no frequent flier I would say I fly with some frequency; at least once sometimes twice a year. But, I hate the feeling of queasiness I get during take off and landing.</description>

      <description>During our recent visit to El Paso, we survived the desert trek to reach Carlsbad Caverns ( number 23 of the 47 U.S. National Parks we plan to visit in our life together). It was a perfect day alone with the man of my dreams exploring and enjoying God’s creation. We spent 5 hours exploring the caves 800 feet below the earth’s surface.
Pictures truly can’t do it justice, but I’ll try.</description>

Oddly enough we were quite familiar with the route has we were only about 11 miles from there this April when we visited Guadeloupe. To get to Carlsbad from El Paso you travel 138 miles on a rather barren and desolate road in the desert.</description>

      <description>Can you tell she loves her Daddy? You can almost hear her giggle with glee as she hugs him. That’s love…
So pure and sweet

      <description>This weekend in addition to enjoying some fishing and campfire doughnuts, we also got to par take in some Pittsburgh Steelers revelry. While camping is always a good time, the reason for our camping trip was so we could spend the afternoon checking up on our boys in the burgh!
This was Scott and my third trip to Latrobe, PA to watch the Steelers practice at training camp. It’s always fun to see the players you watch and cheer on T.</description>

      <description>This recipe for warm and gooey deliciousness is courtesy of Scott’s college room mate. It’s not as easy as popping a mallow on a stick and roasting it, but it is oh so worth the effort! You must try camp fire donuts on your next over night camping trip&amp;hellip;
First you take a can of Pillsbury breadsticks (or a generic equivalent)

Pop it open

Then you begin to wrap the bread dough around a stick</description>

      <description>**Updated Below!
Once we finally departed, the kids were ecstatic about our camping trip this weekend. As we were preparing to leave, my son already started talking about the very, important rules of camping, as he’s discovered them over the years.
And the number one, most exciting rule is that **
camping is messy!
**
This one cracked me up, because while it is true, to hear him talk you would think he grew up in a house where he was never allowed to get dirty.</description>

      <description>Van is fully packed… literally, I don’t think we could fit another thing in there. Careful opening the back door, the sleeping bags will fall when you life it up. Kids buckled in. Dog ready to drop off at my friend’s.
Wait, forgot the tip of the fishing rod. Back in the house.
Scott’s needs a ball cap. Back in the house. After packing, repacking, rearranging the car seats, returning to the house, oh 3 or 4 dozen more times, we are set.</description>

      <description>When the summer began I had big goals and plans for myself. I signed up for the Annapolis 10 Mile Run again this year, this time running with several of my high school friends. I had high hopes of running 3 or 4 times a week all summer. I had already envisioned how great my new, sleek running body would look come the end of August. I also enrolled in a Bible Study at a nearby church that was a hosting a Beth Moore study on the book of Esther.</description>

      <description>The kids have been into “experimenting” these days. We even have science journals with which to record our results. (Yes, we can thank Sid the Science Kid for that brilliant idea).
It started with freezing stuff.
I overheard my son tell his sister with a hushed voice of excitement, “Sis, you watch…we’ll put this cup of water into the freezer and then later when we come back it will be ice.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago we celebrated our youngest child’s second birthday. Naturally on an occasion as significant as a birthday, we had our camera out quite a bit trying to capture every moment of the celebration. It wasn’t till we looked at the pics later on the computer that I realized at perhaps some moments would have been better left, not captured!
Since she loves dogs, we did a puppy dog theme for her party.</description>

      <description>My little man loves to look spiffy for church on Sunday. He’s been asking for “shiny church shoes” for months now. But penny loafers are expensive and I hadn’t been able to find any at the consignment shop. Until this week when I went on a consignment store quest hoping to find some cool looking picture frames for a fun idea I had for my dining room. No luck with the picture frames but we did score a cooler and a pair of “shiny church shoes” in size 11.</description>

      <description>One of the sweetest parts of my day is listening to my kids pray. I love to hear the things they are thankful for at the end of the day. It gives me a glimpse into the things they value most. I can only imagine the smile their heartfelt prayers bring to our Lord as He listens to the cries of their heart.
Tonight as my daughter was praying she thanked God for many things and then said very specifically, “but I am not, not thankful for thunderstorms.</description>

      <description>I love our pediatric dentist office, for many reasons….the play gym in the waiting room, the sun glasses for the kids to wear while the lights shine in their eyes, the cool prizes the kids get to pick out, the pac man games they play between the cleaning and the dentist, but mostly for the people.
Without the kind and patient hygienists and dentists, the games and toys really wouldn’t matter.</description>

      <description>If you’ve been following my tweets or facebook statuses over the past few weeks, then you know I have been crazy cleaning girl here lately. In addition to my late night bathroom scrubbing and Friday night painting parties, today I did something I’ve never done before.
I got a friend to watch my kids so I could do house work.
I’ve had a friend watch the kids so I could go to the OB, or to a school interview, even for some volunteering at the preschool, but for house work?</description>

You know, because naturally the president of the United States would drive a car that looked like an American flag.
I am sure the people at Beltway Brokerage.com would be so happy to know that their car gets such high billing. </description>

      <description>Recently I decided the entry way to our home needed a face lift. For the past 6 years I’ve had a narrow card table covered with a table cloth and some seasonal decor on the top. Sounds classy huh?
Well last month I decided my table had to go. This left me with a bare white wall. 
Nothing says “home sweet home” like a big empty wall of blah.</description>

      <description>I was enchanted by my youngest on Saturday as she played with her dolls. She played quietly and contently for at least an hour. I could have done so much with that time and yet I couldn’t take my eyes off of her. She barely noticed my presence as she sat and arranged her dolls, poured their imaginary tea, and made sure everyone got a sip. Then repeated the endearing process over and over.</description>

The bride looked dashing in her floor length ball gown, with her shoulder length hair worn down. The groom was handsome in his navy blue jacket with a red and gray tie, and a simple black eyed susan taped to his jacket lapel. The bride carried matching black eyes susan’s picked fresh from her mother’s yard.  As the ceremony began the bride’s cell phone rang.</description>

      <description>A strange thing has happened to me in my ripe, “old” age. Since turning thirty I have discovered my taste buds are changing quite a bit. For years I have loved the smell of coffee. And while I do enjoy a cappuccino or especially a good frappuchino, an actual cup of coffee was too strong for my liking. However, I enjoyed the smell so much, I once begged my husband to drink it in the morning, just so we could fill our home with its rich aroma.</description>

      <description>Those of you that have been part of the circus for awhile, know that I seriously lack a green thumb. I guess you could call me naive, but this spring I decided to try again. Much like peach picking, my goal in gardening is to teach my kids. So, I didn’t go for huge garden with hopes of providing a summer’s worth of produce. Instead, I opted for a few plants that we could watch grow and hopefully taste the fruits of our labor.</description>

Anything I can do to make it easier? For those that have linked up in the past, thank you.</description>

      <description>I love birthdays. No really, I mean, I LOVE THEM. And I’ll be honest, I particularly love MY birthday. As I kid I would start counting down the days till my birthday starting in January (right around my brother’s birthday). I can remember when Scott and I had been married about a year we were on vacation at the end of June. My birthday, as you now know is in mid July.</description>

      <description>If crystal doesn&amp;rsquo;t want me commandeering her blog then she really needs to get a better password ;-). Yea, this post is actually being written by Scott. I guess you may know me as the circus dad. Anyway, as a family we have chosen today to celebrate her 30th birthday. Yep, the big 3.0. I’m off all day and we are going to have big fun. Because she loves you all so much I though her day would be all the more fun if she received birthday greetings from some of the faithful readers she spends so much time sharing her life with.</description>

      <description>As much as I like to think I am not, I am a city girl. My “garden” consists of 6 plants in a square patch on the side of my house. We get our eggs in a carton at the grocery store and our milk in gallon jugs just down the aisle from the milk.
So, I try to give my kids farm fresh experiences as much as possible. It takes a bit of driving, but seems like a small price to pay in my book to give my kids prior knowledge experiences.</description>

      <description>My family’s love for Chick-Fil-A goes deep and wide. [
](https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/IMG_0105.jpg)
The first symbol my son recognized was for Chick-Fil-A. He could “read” it at age 2. And anytime he saw a cursive C he thought it stood for Chick-Fil-A. At that same age, I showed him a symbol for the golden arches and he had no idea what it was. My daughter’s one year scrapbooks both have pages dedicated to their “first Chick-Fil-A” kids meal experience.</description>

      <description>Nothing like a week of Vacation Bible School to leave this circus mom with more “not me” moments than I care to admit. Because I love to keep it real, here’s a few highlights from our week.
 Meet my dear friend. When it comes to friends, she’s one of the bestest. For many reasons. An example of which is the fact that she willingly cuts my girls hair for me.</description>

      <description>Sometimes you hear about something so big and so awful and while you know you just can’t ignore it and do nothing, you have no idea what to do.

And sometimes not knowing what to do leads to inaction. How can I make a difference to such a big problem? What can I do to help someone hurting half a world away?
That’s kinda how I felt after writing this weekend thought about Sudan two weeks ago.</description>

      <description>The relationship between siblings is a funny thing. I once read a Times magazine article about siblings that really struck me. It’s funny, 3 years later and I still remember this one line “Our spouses arrive comparatively late in our lives; our parents eventually leave us. Our siblings may be the only people we&amp;rsquo;ll ever know who truly qualify as partners for life.”
Being the mother of three children, I think a lot about the bonds of siblings.</description>

      <description>It’s funny how a simple thing like dinner on a Wednesday night can have an dramatic impact on your life. 7 years ago we went out to dinner with another couple in downtown Annapolis on a Wednesday night. If you know anything about summer in Annapolis then you know that Wednesday nights mean sailing races. (Truth is I grew up around here and just learned that fact 7 years ago).</description>

      <description>Living near the Chesapeake Bay affords us many opportunities for boat watching. “What’s that?” “A sailboat.”
“What’s that?” “A motor boat”
“What’s that?” “A kayak.”
Many such conversations have gone on between the kids and I over the years. Now they happily call out the boats they see as we play at the beach or the park nearby. Last week my kids got all excited when they saw a cruise ship sailing by our park.</description>

      <description>I’ve been to a few parades in my day. Unlike the kids, I’m not all that surprised by what I see. I’ve come to expect the fire trucks, army tanks, corvettes, marching bands…
This year however, there were a few things I hadn’t seen before. 
Gotta love keeping it green with the organic fertilizer. Not your typical parade entry.
This was probably my favorite though. 
I’m all for safety, really I am, but if that missile accidentally goes off, how much good will that fire extinguisher do?</description>

      <description>This weekend our family, like many across the country, will gather together, and after watching a small town parade, we’ll enjoy some barbeque and corn on the cob, and conclude the evening with a gorgeous fireworks display. Meanwhile, our troops are away from their friends and families. They are not sipping lemonade on the back porch, while grilling up some burgers. Tonight they will not be holding their children on their laps as they watch the fireworks burst in the air.</description>

      <description>I remember very little from my college biology class. The one thing that sticks in my brain is the genetics unit. I can remember sitting there running through the calculations and thinking, “If Scott and I were to get married we’d have blue eyed kids.” The hopeless romantic, head over heels in love teen that I was, I enjoyed the game of “wonder if.” The other thing from the genetics unit that sticks out is that the ability to touch your tongue to your nose is genetically dictated.</description>

      <description>This weekend, I surprised Scott and the kids with a high seas adventure in Annapolis. After donning their costumes  
And getting their tattoos

We were ready to board the ship and set sail in search of our treasure

The kids used their loot to purchase ice cream for dinner. A good time was had by all. Though I fear the pirate life may agree too well with them.</description>

Yea, I also never thought I’d bring my kids to church with mismatched shoes and no diaper bag…but
5 years and 3 kids later and super mom has left the building.</description>

      <description>Thanks for all who wrote last week with your thoughts and suggestions on my dinner time dilemma.
No worries though.
Tonight my kids sat down and ate their dinner without one complaint.
Not one. And let me tell you there was no dilly dallying. They sat on the curb, gobbled it up with relatively little mess and we were on our merry way, walking around downtown enjoying the boats and the harbor.</description>

      <description>Last summer I took a Sunday School class in which I was introduced to a concept called solidarity and I realized I had very little of it. Before that class I was really very uneducated and honestly uncaring about events and situations going on in other parts of the world. If a plane crashed in Illinois, I’d be all over cnn.com reading the footage and following the case. “How tragic,” I’d think.</description>

      <description>“How are you?” This simple phrase is uttered countless times a day. Though typically without the asker really wanting or waiting for a reply.
“Hi How are you?”
You say it the grocery store clerk, the man on the sidewalk, the telemarketer…and yet, honestly, how often do you wait or listen to the response?
The expected response is “Good, How are you?”
My kids could have been screaming at the top of their lungs , the dog just pooped on the rug again, and my sink is clogged and over flowing, and yet I smile and answer “Good, how are you?</description>

      <description>Dinner time….the family all gathered around the table, enjoying a delicious meal, talking about the day, laughing and enjoying one another…statistics say that families that consistently eat dinner together tend to raise healthier, more well behaved children, then families that don’t. So, what are we doing wrong?
More often than not the Circus Family eats breakfast and dinner together as a family. More often than not our dinner “hour” is more like a dinner hour and a half.</description>

      <description>While most of America celebrated Father’s Day yesterday, the circus family did not. Shh…Please don’t tell the circus children. They think Father’s Day is next week, because that’s when we are celebrating it. We paint pumpkins in Nov and build gingerbread houses in Jan, so why can’t we celebrate dear old dad one week late? Yes, we are shamelessly pulling the wool over our innocent children’s eyes.
Scott and I wanted to get away for a weekend alone, just the two of us, as our gift to each other for our 30th birthdays this year.</description>

So, here’s the family secret.
Yup, buy yourself a box of Sure Jell, add 4 cups of crushed berries, and 4 cups of sugar, and you are set!</description>

      <description>Life on the sidelines can be rough. I know, I’ve been there. Sat the bench for 4 years of high school lacrosse. But unlike her mother, my little girl sits on the side because she is too young, not because she isn’t good enough.

My daughter is dying to play like her brother. It is so cute and yet so painful to watch her on the sidelines. When the coach calls the team to line up at the bench during practice, she is right there with the rest of them.</description>

      <description>This spring I declared that this summer, summer of 2009 would be the circus family’s summer of swimming. The past several summers I’ve either had an infant or been ready to pop and really haven’t devoted the time necessary to teach my crew how to swim. I’ve given some half hearted attempts, but the bottom line is my kids can’t swim.
And when you live near the bay as we do, it really is a necessity.</description>

      <description>Sometimes a mother’s ability to multitask isn’t a good thing… as I attempt to juggle one to many balls, I find that I can accidentally drop one and not even realize it for several hours.
Last week while I was talking on the phone and cleaning up the living room, I noticed the kids sitting on the floor with some stuffed animals and scissors.
I keenly observed that something looked amiss, so I grabbed the scissors from my sons hands, quickly told him that they needed to be used only at the table, and went to the other room.</description>

      <description>My youngest child is fearless. FEARLESS
When we go to the playground she’s off and running, climbing to the top of the big slide, coming and going without looking back. She’ll slide down the stairs of my house with the speed of a bob sled racer. She tries very hard to keep up with her older siblings and she does it well.
The other day we were at a cookout and the kids were clamoring around a tree stump catching toads.</description>

My cell plan is simply that - a cell phone. While I can send and receive texts it costs a pretty penny.</description>

      <description>My kids made an important decision this week. After much deliberation, they’ve finally figured out their Halloween costumes for next fall. And really, not a moment too soon… what with 146 days till Halloween, it’s a good thing we’ve got it settled. My son will be Luke Skywalker (he told me this week that he wished when he was a baby we had name him Luke Skywalker). My 3 year old will be Princess Leia.</description>

      <description>I knew being a mom wouldn’t be easy. And I’ve survived the middle of the night feedings, the tantrums of the terrible twos, the struggle for independence…but that all feels like child play compared to the task of this week.
This week I was reminded of the fact that sometimes there is very little a mom can do to protect her young from getting hurt. Sending your children off into the world, is like sending your heart out there, exposed for the world to trample on.</description>

      <description>There is something alluring, almost magical about the buttons on an elevator. My kids enthusiastically clamor for the opportunity to press the shiny buttons both outside and inside of the elevator. We have a routine when entering elevators which typically works flawlessly. One child pushes the button on the outside. The second child then pushes the same button. Once inside they each get a turn pushing the button for the floor we want to go on.</description>

      <description>My friend and I were riding in the car one day when the song “Creed” by Third Day came on. I told my friend something to the effect of, “I love this song, it’s like everything I believe.”
To which she laughed (not exactly the response I was expecting) and said, “Your kidding right? You know this is the Apostles Creed.”
No wonder I was so impressed with the statement of faith.</description>

      <description>While you might think that the potential pink eye, multiple ear infections, and laryngitis would scare me away from ever taking the circus crew on another national park vacation, it doesn’t. Just call me crazy!
I’ll admit, parts of our Texas vacation wasn’t all we hoped and dreamed it would be.
But, I am glad we went and eager to visit some more national parks.
So this afternoon I sat down to map out a potential trip to Florida.</description>

      <description>Keep it real… I try really hard to make that my mantra in blogging and in life. That is why I leap at the chance to participate in carnivals like this one, where I can join up wither other real bloggers and rip off any fake facades of perfection. Because really, who has time for facades when you’re chasing three naked kids around the house, trying to find matching shoes, and attempting to get out the door on time?</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I wrote about our kindergarten dilemma for next year.
After months of praying, discussing, putting of decision making, visiting, observing, and more discussing, I found it refreshing to have it out of my hands.
 Last week my son graduated from preschool. At the class picnic I was bombarded with questions about where he would go to school in the fall. I was telling one friend about our situation and she responded, “Well, it sounds like one of those things that will obviously be God working.</description>

      <description>My kids each have a blanket that their grandma made for them before they were born. Being the creative individuals that they are, they call them their “grandma blankets.” I know, ingenious, huh?
The other day I was laying on my daughter’s bed when I had a realization. “Hey”, I said, “this blanket is my grandma blanket.” She laughed and thought I was joking.
“No,” I said, “this blanket right here was made for me by my grandma when I was a little girl, so it is my grandma blanket.</description>

      <description>My oldest son is five. He’s gotten to the point where he wants things. And his birthday and Christmas are over. He’s already proven that he has the self control and discipline to save up for things. But he has no income.
I would like to start developing in him the discipline to save and to choose wisely how to spend his money. So, I was wondering, do any of you give your children allowances?</description>

Hmm, do you think we enjoyed ourselves?</description>

Puddle Jumping

Seems she was just learning to crawl.
How is that she’s running around, skinning her knees and swinging beside the big kids?
Didn’t she know she wasn’t supposed to grow up so fast?
She’s my baby.
What is she doing conversing and counting and going on the potty?
Where did my baby go?
And who is this pig tailed princess that’s serenading us in the morning with her sweet cherub voice?</description>

      <description>I’m trying to cultivate my garden so I did a lot of weeding this past week. And as I did I found there are two ways to weed. You can pick each individual weed out by hand, or you can whack them all with a hoe. Both are effective and appropriate methods for weeding.
But, each has an appropriate time and place. In my old garden which was empty of any vegetation except for weeds, the hoe was the method of choice.</description>

      <description>I can’t believe the school year is over all ready. More than that I can’t believe my little guy is going to be a kindergartener next fall. Where did the time go? It truly seems like it wasn’t that long ago when he was taking his first steps. And now he’ll be stepping across the stage…ready to commence a new stage of life.
He is no longer a preschooler.
I’m so proud of him.</description>

Meanwhile I am emptying the dish washer, wiping up spills, and maybe.. maybe checking face book.</description>

      <description>Thanks to Becky and her super fun WOW (within one week) carnival, I managed to tackle my overgrown flower beds and get them spruced up in time for summer. I realize many of you did your spring planting early this spring, but I already told you yesterday, I am not always timely.
Check out the before and after.
Flower Bed #1:

I’d still like to cut my rose bushes down some, but I think you will agree it looks MUCH better than it did last week.</description>

      <description>I have become a procrastinator. Actually I am worse than a procrastinator b/c procrastinators put things off till the last minute and then get them done. I didn’t used to be this way but now I tend to put them off till the last minute and then the deadline passes and I am still left with the job undone. Case in point: I bought my mom her mothers day card at the end of April.</description>

      <description>Between baseball practice, swim lessons, sailing races, and deacon meetings, our evenings can get quite busy. And one thing my family is passionate about is their food. Not so keen on skipping diner. So, to keep dinner on the table, I have found it is helpful to have a plan. I must confess I used to be much better about the plan. I’d write up my meal plan for the month and then make my grocery list based on it.</description>

      <description>My son recently discovered the term “Summer Vacation” and in the innocence that only youth gives, he was quite disheartened when he learned that preschool didn’t last all summer long.
The fact that he’ll be in Kindergarten and not returning to his preschool didn’t help the matter.
It’s been so fun to watch him grow this past year at preschool. When we were looking at school’s last spring, I wasn’t sure where we wanted to send him.</description>

Well, Becky’s got a carnival going on this week to inspire us to tackle those projects we’ve been meaning to get to, but haven’t.</description>

      <description>I am quickly approaching a new age bracket. The thirty somethings. It hit me rather squarely in the face yesterday when I looked into a women’s Bible study at a nearby church. I got so excited when I found a Beth Moore study meeting at a church less than 5 minutes from my house. I quickly e-mailed an acquaintance from that church before even reading the small print. The study I mentioned to her was for 18-30 year old women, she replied.</description>

      <description>One of my hubby’s fav breakfast foods is my home made coffee cake. I often make it for him on special occasions like Valentine’s Day, our anniversary, or his birthday.
Because you can make it the night before, it is great to serve for overnight guests. Or for freakishly early breakfast guests like I had this weekend. My son had a 9:30 baseball game on Saturday and we had invited my husband’s extended family over for breakfast before the game.</description>

      <description>Sometimes after reading the kids their bedtime Bible story we start to wonder, are they listening? Are they getting the point of the stories? Every once and a while they offer up another reminder that they really are.
Tonight after reading our children the story of Daniel and the Lions Den, my husband tried a little follow up to see if our 5 year old son was connecting…

      <description>Much like I do almost every day, I loaded my sweet baby girl into her car seat. I buckled her in and then handed her a purple sippy cup.
After strapping her sister in her seat and after double checking her brother, I went to my spot in the front. About 20 minutes later I looked back and saw my sweet baby girl holding two purple sippy cups.

      <description>I write to you today with a happy heart. 3 days ago my bloggy world and my real life world collided at lunch in Pittsburgh. As I drove to my meeting place, I was a bit nervous. “What if we run out of things to say? Will she like me when she meets me in person?” It felt quite similar to those first date jitters. (No I wasn’t worried about whether or not she’d kiss me when she dropped me off at the end).</description>

      <description>I am not an athlete. Those of you blog readers who knew me in high school can vouch for me on this. My position on the HS sport team was bench warmer, my role, “team encourager.” When my recent blog friend turned IRL friend accompanied me this weekend to pick up my runners pack for the Pittsburgh Half Marathon and called me athletic, I almost laughed in her face.
Me athletic?</description>

      <description>The other night at dinner my daughter was not so excited about eating her peas.

So, her little sister decided to step in and help her!

Sisters make everything better… even eating your greens!

Sometimes you just need a little encouragement!</description>

      <description>When my little man sets his heart on something, you better watch out. Because he will hold on tight with his 5 year old death grip on life!
 His preschool had an art festival last week. It was the single best fundraising event I have ever attended. Parents paid a $10 admission per child and the kids got to engage in numerous, fun, messy, outside art projects. It was a glorious way to spend a sunny Saturday afternoon.</description>

      <description>Been sorting through the kids clothes, bagging up the stuff too small, cleaning out stuff in the nursery&amp;hellip;. I am so sad.
It is so weird to think we might be done having babies&amp;hellip;. so strange&amp;hellip;. so sad&amp;hellip;. I feel on the brink of tears. I have been trying all week to mentally prepare that we might be done, to figure out how to clean out the stuff and move on, but it is a lot harder than I thought.</description>

      <description>My son has always been a thinker, thinking things through one step ahead and drawing some unpredictable conclusions. The following conversation took place last week between my son and his Daddy.
Son: Dad, I really want to go fishing. Dad: Oh, that does sound like fun. The bummer though is that it&amp;rsquo;s not fishing season so we can&amp;rsquo;t go fishing. Son: Why is it not fishing season? Dad: Well, if we fished all the time we would run out of fish to fish.</description>

      <description>Today was a big day in the life of sibling relations at the circus. Around my daughter’s third birthday, my strong willed, independent, knows what she wants toddler, morphed into a “whatever big brother does, that’s what I want too” little sister (she still kept her strong will however). Her favorite color went from purple to red (her brother’s fav color). For the past week she has been telling me how she wants a Spiderman cake just like her brothers when it is her birthday.</description>

      <description>Apparently my daughter’s week long rebellion was against sleeping alone in her crib and not on sleeping in general. Tuesday was a break through day for us!
She napped and slept through the night without screaming for hours first.
As I said goodnight to her in her sister’s bed, she had the BIGGEST grin on her face. Seriously, I have never seen a kid so excited about sleeping in a bed.</description>

      <description>Since we first brought my youngest home from the hospital at two days old, she has been a good sleeper. You could just lay her down and walk away and she would soothe herself to sleep. Scott and I commented a few months ago that we haven’t had to go in the middle of the night to help soothe her back to sleep. Even when she threw up in her crib in the middle of the night, she just rolled back over and went to sleep.</description>

      <description>My son is obsessed with all things Spiderman. I remember when he was about 2 and he saw a picture of Spiderman on something in the grocery store. He asked me what that was and I told him Spiderman. I remember he giggled saying that was so silly, to have a spider man. Sometime since then, he got bit by the spidey bug! I love this picture…the smile on his face was worth all the effort it took to make that cake!</description>

      <description>Sorry to leave you all hanging with my sarcastic tribute to San Antonio…I’ve spend the last 24 hours prepping for and then hosting my son’s 5th birthday…(How did he end up being 5 already)? But, I’ll save that for another post… one involving sinister villains, and superheroes…be sure to come back next week for that one! I do want to clarify, that even though we did spend 4 hours in the urgent care facility, we did have a great time in San Antonio.</description>

      <description>After 4 days of camping at both Guadalupe and Big Bend NP, the next big destination on our trip was to San Antonio. We were quite excited about showers, and more room to spread out. After checking into our hotel at noon, we were off to see the sights.
Where to first? The Alamo? The Children’s Museum? The River walk? So many choices…
We thought what better place to go to really experience the city than the urgent care clinic.</description>

      <description>The sun’s rays cast a bright orange glow on the rocks when it rose in the morning.

As the day went on, the bees came out to pollinate the flora.

As the day progressed, we were able to pose for the very significant sign shot. Click here to learn of it’s high importance.

As the sun began to set the rocks began to change color yet again.</description>

So, any guesses on which national park this is from?</description>

      <description>While I have enjoyed the many ups and downs of our vacation to Texas, I have decided that I never again want to go on vacation the week prior to Easter. I was very careful when planning our trip to make sure that we would be with family for Easter so that we could go to church and worship our Lord. I didn’t want to be camping or in the middle of nowhere for Easter Sunday.</description>

      <description>Besides taking in the beautiful scenery (of which there was much) at Guadalupe and Big Bend National Parks, we really enjoyed being able to just be together (most of the time). Each day at Big Bend we took a very, long picnic lunch. One day we went to the western portion of the park and enjoyed a leisurely picnic. I thought it would be fun to make our own ice cream in coffee cans using a recipe I had found online.</description>

      <description>I’d say good ol’ Dickens phrase aptly describes our week of camping in Texas. We’ve had us some great times this week… saw some beautiful handiworks of God’s creation and enjoyed time away from everyday life together as a family. I look forward to sharing many such anecdotes and pictures with you over the next few posts, but I gotta admit, we’ve had our “moments” as well.
It was the sickness that got to us.</description>

      <description>My last guest blogger for this week is Monica. I stumbled across Monica’s blog shortly after I started blogging last year and was instantly hooked. She and her husband Keith have been married a little longer than Scott and I and we both have three kids around the same ages. Her love for the Lord, her husband, and her children shines through in each of her posts. We’ve had the chance to chat back and forth via e-mail and I am certain if she lived in town instead of across the Atlantic, we would certainly enjoy spending time together.</description>

      <description>Saturday we ventured out for White Sands, NM. We had high hopes for some sand sledding. I was expecting it to be like this.
Only there is this phenomenon in Texas we recently discovered called Wind Season. Who knew? (Yes, knowledge of this would have been helpful in planning our vacation). So when we arrived at White Sands we discovered something called a sand storm.

And unlike a snow storm, sand storms hurt.</description>

NICE, huh?

      <description>We made it. And more amazingly than that. So did our 5 suitcases, pack-n-play, and 3 car seats! We had a very gracious man checking us in who gave us time to sort our bags and let one slide which was slightly over the 50lb limit. Then we were blessed when we went to the car rental agency and got a stow and go van (which will make carting our 5 suitcases around much easier) and Scott was somehow able to talk them into a price several hundred dollars cheaper than the estimate we had gotten online.</description>

You haven’t see the circus till you’ve see 2 adults, three preschoolers, our 8 checked bags and our 4 carry on items go through the check in line and security. Let’s throw in a little reshuffling of items in our bags to try and make all of our bags meet the weight limit.</description>

      <description>To the smart mom or dad who invented the quiet game.
I say, “THANK YOU!”
Seriously, you’ve changed my life…or at least my commute to and from the grocery store. Last week in a desperate attempt to keep my sanity as I drove my three overly tired, overly hungry, did I mention whiny, children home from B.J.’s I remembered this game of my youth. And given the highly competitive nature of my two oldest, I thought they just might take to it.</description>

      <description>Timely, we are not.
But we do follow through…eventually.
We promised our daughter on her third birthday in early Feb, that her gift from us would be a special trip with Mommy and Daddy to make her own teddy bear.
Two months later, the magical moment happened.
After dropping her siblings off at Nana and Pop’s, Scott and I realized this was the first time we had spent time, just the three of us, since she was in the hospital three years ago!</description>

So, tomorrow we’ll be having some arctic cereal. ( The night before April Fools&#39; day, pour milk over half a bowl of cereal and put it in the freezer.</description>

I’m going to follow you on twitter - I just started doing it as well, but have no clue what I’m doing!</description>

      <description>God Bless Sunday School teachers…especially the teachers of those dear two and three year olds. How they keep those squiggling, squirming little bodies still on those carpet squares to hear the whole lesson is beyond me.
Perhaps, it’s occasionally beyond them too. Seems they don’t always get quite the whole lesson.
At lunch today I was asking my three year old what she learned about in Sunday School. I was so excited to get an answer beyond the typical, “God” or “Jesus”.</description>

      <description>One year ago today I entered into this crazy blogging world. My initial post was very short and my commenter&amp;rsquo;s were only IRL friends and family. For awhile I only received comments from my mom, my mother in law or one of my two sisters in law. Now I have by no means “made it” in the blogging world. If anything, I have learned that there are a gazillion mommy bloggers out there with cute kids and tales to share.</description>

      <description>My son loves baseball. I am not sure exactly where this love comes from since his dad and I are both avid football fans, but could care less about baseball. Didn’t even watch the World Series. In fact, the only baseball I’ve watched over the past few years, I’ve watched with my son. As a 2 year old, he would ask for it on TV and we’d sit and watch several innings on ESPN or catch a little on Sports Center.</description>

      <description>Not exactly wordless this week, but since it is in fact Wednesday, I decided to share some pictures from our week.
Our Little Lady: All dressed up with no place to go!

She was so proud when she discovered her “new trick” “Mom, I can do my ‘noisy medicine’ (aka nebulizer) while playing legos…this is my new trick!”

Someone got into Mommy’s dresser and proudly paraded down the hall saying, “Pretty”</description>

      <description>Tonight my son had his very first baseball practice and he was as cute as could be and I am dying to share some pix of the occasion, but my brain is complete mush after taking care of my sick girls all day (and it’s clear we still have a very long night ahead of us). I will save it for later this week when I can give it the time it deserves.</description>

      <description>We’ve been battling some germs here at the circus. Everything from ear infections, stomach bugs, croup, asthma attacks… we seem to have had it all, and then had it again. After this week’s bout of croup went from kid to kid (with the baby waking up today with a fever) I am thinking Momma could use some chocolate. So, during nap time today I plan to whip up some of these (my favs) and enjoy a little chocolate fix while I try to catch up on some blog reading and commenting.</description>

I’ve been blogging for almost a year now. What started as a fulfillment of my new years resolution, has grown into a means of making new friends and reconnecting with old ones as I share my circus life as a wife and stay at home mom of three active preschoolers.</description>

      <description>When my oldest doesn’t take a nap, I am often looking for creative ways for him to play quietly while the girls sleep and I do “whatever I do” during nap time. Often time he plays quietly in his nap room (I separate the kids during nap time so they aren’t sleeping in the same room) or will play a computer game. Some days, however, I give him the point and shoot and let him have fun with his artistic side.</description>

      <description>Someday when I open my silverware drawer I will find each piece sitting neatly in the slot it belongs.
Someday my kids won’t come running when they hear me opening the dishwasher, eager to help put the dishes away.
And I will look back on these days when my 19 mth old did it all by herself with longing.
So, today I am enjoying the help!

A few weeks ago when I discovered this
 after my daughter’s naptime, I left a face book status that I was wondering how to get marker off of a baby doll face and within the hour I had 15 helpful tips.</description>

Me: No, I’m just putting it on my blog. Son: But I want this picture for my scrapbook.
Me: That’s fine, you can still have the picture, they’re not taking it, just looking at it.</description>

      <description>5 years ago if you had told me that I would care, I mean really care, about a little stuffed animal blankey, I would have laughed. Shortly before I stopped teaching my third graders threw me a “surprise” baby shower. One of my students gave me a blankey/stuffed animal all in one. You know those things that have an animal head on one end, blankey in the middle and feet and buttom on the other end?</description>

      <description>My daughter loves to change her clothes. We go through a clothing change at least, AT LEAST 4 times a day. Thankfully, she can dress herself and requires little assistance from me. Typically she rotates through her most favorite articles of clothing. In addition to her candy pants, she’s added a silk pair of pj pants to her collection, as well as a too tight Winnie the Pooh pajama shirt.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago my son came up to me and asked if Prince Charming was always the prince. I told him yes. His eyes got really big and he said, “Wow, that is a lot of princesses to take care of.” Apparently, he wasn’t done pondering the subject, because later while holding up his sister’s sippy cup, he remarked, “That’s too many princesses for one guy… you’re only supposed to have one.</description>

      <description>Those that have followed me in the past, know I love holidays. Here at the circus we celebrate any time we get a chance. Who doesn’t love some themed treats and fun crafts? But two holidays hold special significance for us. Christmas and Easter
They are not just days to get dressed up and partake of traditions.
And to set them a part we spend a great deal of time, as in weeks, preparing for them.</description>

      <description>This winter Scott and I watched the movie The Pursuit of Happyness starring Will Smith. Few movies have stuck with me as much as this one. My heart was so heavy as I watched this very smart man struggle to provide for his son. The thing that got Scott and I the most, was how immensely blessed we are. We were given so many opportunities that others don’t get. We don’t have what we do because we deserve it.</description>

      <description>Scott and I have found a new way to spend a Saturday night together.
For two and half years now Scott has been going into a nearby city to distribute bagged lunches to the homeless as part of our church’s homeless ministry. Typically, I stay home with the kids while he goes. In January, I had the opportunity of joining him. I had been once before about a year ago, but still I was nervous.</description>

      <description>This week Scott had a business trip.
It could not have come at a worse time for him. He has some big deadlines at work and this trip meant 3 days away from the office. He knew before he left that he would return swamped. It seemed there were more reasons for him not to go, than to go. And while it seemed not to make any sense, away he went.</description>

Remember those days? Nothing better topped off a hard week of going to school and talking on the phone like a little Full House, Family Matters, and Perfect Strangers. T.G.I.F.
If ever there was a week that needed an end, this week here at the circus, was it.
What with puke, and then puke, then a missed gymnastics performance due to puke, and then missing your best friends birthday party thanks to your sisters puke, followed by more puke, then a power outage, puke, snow, still more puke, then Daddy away on a business trip, his homecoming strangely enough followed the next morning by still more puke…</description>

  What makes mom happy? Son: obeying mom and loving mom</description>

a power outage
Nice, huh? At around 1:30 am I was giving my daughter a nebulizer treatment for her asthma when the power started flickering.</description>

      <description>Kids make good accountability partners. Whether you ask them to be or not.
As a SAHM mom, I am with my kids pretty much all day and evening. With the exception of an evening out here or there. And my kids are watching me. They are taking in what I listen to on the radio, how I respond when I am tired, stressed. They are there for it all.
I have been impressed and sometimes surprised with how carefully they are listening to the words of the lyrics we listen to.</description>

      <description>It’s been a few years since we’ve had a good snow fall here in MD. And by good I mean accumulating enough so that you don’t see the grass poking through the snow. This is the only snowman we were able to scrape together this winter at the circus. Don’t the kids look kind of forlorn? 
Seriously, take a closer look at our “snowman.” I am sure my friends up north are rolling on the floor with laughter at our patheticness.</description>

      <description>Scott and I enjoy watching those “thrill drama series” such as 24, Alias, Heroes… I can remember when we would watch Alias, I would often have dreams where I would save the day with my mean back side kick and my “kickn” purple air. Ya, if only…
Well this morning I woke up and told Scott I had the strangest dream. In part of it we were going away for our honeymoon only it wasn’t really because we already had the kids and we were staying in this hotel like room underground in my parents yard.</description>

My son then commented, “I have no idea who Mr. Black is but we gotta get rid of him.”
I suggested maybe he was a cavity.
“Yea or dead food.” he replied.</description>

      <description>I have been going non stop the past several days. Friends over for dinner, going to other friends homes for dinner, attending a party, hosting a surprise party…it has been social function after social function for 5 days straight. I have enjoyed each experience greatly, but I am an introvert and after spending time with people I need time alone to recharge. I have one more event tonight (a MOPS Family Fun Night at our church…being as I am the coordinator, I need to be there and be fun).</description>

      <description>Sometimes it takes very little to turn the ordinary into something memorable. If your willing to change things up a bit, you can have fun with really, very little effort.
The other day the kids and I baked some cookies for a care package, but we saved some to enjoy with Daddy after dinner. While we don’t have dessert everyday, a chocolate chip cookie after dinner is not all that memorable.</description>

      <description>Have you ever been singing along to a song in front of your friends when you learn that the lyrics you thought you knew weren’t quite right?
I can remember in high school singing along to Amy Grant’s “Baby Baby” and when she says, “Baby Baby, I’m taken with the notion to love you with the sweetest of devotion” I instead belted out “love you with the sweetest talk of ocean.</description>

      <description>You ever ever start playing a game without even realizing it until it’s well underway? Two years ago the kids and I were shopping in the candy aisle at Rite Aid looking for cheap V-day candy after the 14th, when we stumbled across this guy selling on clearance for a little over a dollar.

 My son was big into motorcycles and Snoopy, so it was fun gift for him.</description>

      <description>Welcome to Not Me! Monday! This blog carnival was created by MckMama. You can head over to her blog to read what she and everyone else have not been doing this week.
While I was posting about my true love story each day last week, a whole circus load of activity was going on around here.
I did not…
 put my kids to bed without having them brush their teeth because we got home late from a church meeting and I was trying to rush the bedtime routine.</description>

      <description>Scott asked the kids their thoughts on the new stimulus bill that’s been passed. Let’s just say they are a little less than enthused. We had no idea this conversation would end in tears.
Have no fear. Scott consoled him right after we fade to black. He really does &amp;ldquo;get it&amp;rdquo; but there is no reason to let him continue to worry about something he can&amp;rsquo;t yet control.</description>

      <description>Thanks for sticking around this week for the last installment in my week long saga of how the circus began.
It was spring break of our junior year. The plan (or so I thought) was to spend the first part of break at my parents house and the last part in MD at his parents house.
Wednesday we drove to MD and Thursday we had plans for a fun date in DC.</description>

      <description>I have been having a ton of fun on my walk down memory lane this week. (click here to read the beginning of the story).The other day I opened up a hat box which I have filled with Every.Single.Card and note Scott wrote me from our pre-marriage days and our first 2 years of married life. I told you my love language was words of affirmation and if you needed the proof, it is in the box.</description>

      <description>I am sucker for holidays and tend to go all out for them. Valentine’s is no exception. We’ve got the heart shaped clings on the windows, our wedding picture on our entry table and big plans for strawberry milk and heart shaped pancakes for breakfast on Saturday morning.
This isn’t anything new. Back in high school I looked forward to the day even when I didn’t have a boyfriend to celebrate with.</description>

      <description>I left off on my love story yesterday with the note my husband wrote me on the back of his senior picture. A few weeks later we did in fact “spend time together after school.” It was the day before Thanksgiving and we had a half day of school. The plan was for him to come to my house that afternoon to watch Toy Story.
I was both nervous and excited.</description>

      <description>In honor of Valentine’s Day I thought I’d share my love story with you all this week.
I mentioned before that prior to being voted “Most Congenial” Scott and I had only had 2 conversations with each other throughout high school. After the 4th photo shoot, we got one acceptable enough to put in the yearbook, and I started to notice what a genuinely nice guy he was. Sadly though, we had no classes together.</description>

      <description>We celebrated my daughter’s third birthday last weekend and in honor of that milestone, I thought I’d write her a letter. Perhaps I will take Wilma’s idea and pen it out to give to her at a later date. Until then, at least I will have the thoughts preserved.
Dear Daughter,
 I can’t believe it’s been three years since you entered the world. You are a tiny girl with a lot of spunk and you’ve always had a connection with your daddy that only daughter’s can have.</description>

      <description>As we finished up dinner tonight a song came on the ipod that made Scott want to dance and he invited me to join him. So we did a little swing dancing in the living room with the kids watching from the table.
Then my son got up and grabbed the “point and shoot” we sometimes let him use to take pictures with and took some pictures of us “to put on my wall” he said.</description>

      <description>My oldest daughter has been demonstrating her growing independence and her new sense of style these days. Her new favorite pants are these orange leggings with candy corn on them that she got at Halloween. I don’t know what made her take such a liking to them this January but she wants to wear them EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. When she wanted to wear them to the park a few weeks ago with her purple sweater, I started to try and persuade her to change.</description>

      <description>Home made chocolate chip cookies are my favorite! I am partial to the recipe my mom got years ago. Perhaps you’ve seen the recipe as well. The story goes someone asked for Mrs. Fields cookie recipe and was told it cost two fifty. Upon receiving the recipe, she learned it cost two hundred and fifty dollars rather than two dollars and fifty cents. Outraged, she went on to share this recipe with the world to get back at them for charging so much.</description>

      <description>Well, January came and went and I exercised one day in 2009. This is why I have to set goals for myself. Without a race in my future, I lack the discipline to get off my butt.
So, I’ve set my sights on a Half Marathon in May in one of my favorite cities…Pittsburgh. I am really excited. I checked out the route online and it looks great…we cross two bridges, run downtown a bit, run along the river overlooking the city and my highlight, we run by Heinz Field (home of the Superbowl Champs)!</description>

      <description>Since you’ve seen the decor at the circus for the big game, I thought I’d give you a glimpse of the cast members as well.
We had some fun last night, that is FOR SURE!!!
My daughter and her Papa wore their Steelers jackets to church Sunday morning. 
The kids had their faces painted for the game to show some Steelers pride!

Great Grandpa snapped a picture of the hang celebrating during half time!</description>

      <description>Since many people have asked how we we are celebrating the Superbowl, I thought I’d give you all a glimpse of the circus on Superbowl Sunday.
We didn’t invite a ton of friends over b/c to be honest, we want to be watching the game and not playing host and hostess. We invited my parents, Scott’s parents, and Scott’s grandfather over to watch the game with us. The rule is you gotta route for Pittsburgh to be welcome here and during the game, there is no talking.</description>

      <description>I mentioned before, that Scott and I have not made any decisions regarding the size of our circus crew. Some days we feel quite complete with our trio, others there’s that desire to add another little one to the crew. So, we haven’t done anything drastic and we’re spending some time praying and thinking on it. But the crew members are starting to share their feelings on the matter. Not that we asked them their opinion mind you.</description>

Happy Birthday Little Brother!
Here we are at one of his birthdays. I am guessing he was five or 6, making me 8 or 9.</description>

      <description>We have a few daily battles here at the circus which I have to mediate carefully. One involves who buckled their top straps first in the car seat and the other is over who gets to eat off of the coveted plate at meal time. I made the innocent mistake of purchasing three different animal face plates last year at Target. I also bought some basic color plates as well. I was careful to make sure I got red and purple (my son and daughter’s favorite colors as well as 2 others since they baby didn’t yet have an opinion on colors and it was nice to have extras for when friends are visiting).</description>

      <description>Last week in church the pastor gave an illustration in which he mentioned the number of American lives lost during various wars in our history. My son looked over at me and asked why he was talking about American soldiers getting killed.
This led to a discussion later in the week in which it was brought to my attention that my son was under the impression that good guys don’t die in war.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago Scott’s cousin was married in CA. Since the groom was from Brazil, we were among many friends and relatives that weren’t able to attend the ceremony. The family thoughtfully broadcasted the ceremony live on the internet. I had never attending a wedding this way before. While we would have preferred to attend the wedding in person and share in their celebration with them, in some ways, it was the easiest way to watch the ceremony with our three kids present.</description>

      <description>I recently discovered a way to entertain and delight my children, while also getting some help in the kitchen. I let them wash dishes in the sink by hand. 
I don’t give them anything fragile. But at almost 3 and almost 5, they are quite capable of scrubbing pots and pans or large bowls…things I can’t squeeze into the dishwasher. They beg me for the opportunity and it keeps them content for up an hour.</description>

The entire circus fam is fighting colds. Runny noses, coughs…we felt them coming on at the end of last week but oddly enough standing in 15 degree weather for 4 hours did little to fight them off.</description>

Scott and I were in our seats by 4:45. We were too excited to stay away any longer. When we looked out into the stadium, it was obvious who the non season ticket holders were. There was a sprinkling of us around the stadium. Rookies eager to enjoy every precious minute of the event. As we sat down in our seat (only three rows back in the upper level) we could see everything!</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I was talking with a friend of mine about the Steelers game. She had offered her condolences on our loss against Tennessee. I told her I wasn’t too worried about it because we were going to the play offs. She looked at my kind of incredulously and asked, “Really?”
“Yea,” I said.
“Your going to the playoffs? That’s crazy.”
I was kinda confused, we were after all the leader of our division, and then it hit me…</description>

      <description>As a kid I really enjoyed being on stage. Had a rather significant part in our church musical when I was in third grade which led me to believe I had skill…even did a few plays in middle school (with embarrassing tales of their own to be shared on future Thursdays) but the high school band plays were my low points.
Each spring our school would put on a play written by our band director.</description>

But if anyone wondered why I call it life at the circus…
…just caught my 18th month old brushing her teeth with her brother’s tooth brush, in the dog bowl…
gross on so many levels…</description>

      <description>Sometimes little snippets of the extraordinary appear in the midst of everyday life. Right smack in the middle of a messy kitchen with trashcans overflowing, and kids walking around half naked, a conversation took place at our dining room table. Scott was having eggnog with the two oldest children and I had gotten the video camera out to catch my littlest one playing with the tripod. She was walking around setting up the tripod and exclaiming, “Cheese.</description>

      <description>Eggnog has always been a special drink at our house. Since our son was just a toddler, he’s enjoyed sipping this treat with his Daddy.
Last winter as Scott and my son were enjoying this holiday treat, Scott told him that eggnog is a talking drink. “You sip it slowly like a dessert and talk about important things,” he instructed him.
From this was born eggnog talks.
The next night my three and half year hold son asked for some eggnog, then looked up at his Daddy and said, “Dad, let’s talk…how was your day?</description>

      <description>My son has always had a very inquisitive nature. When I was pregnant with my third child, he was three. He fully grasped the concept that there was a baby in my belly. But, what he wanted to know was, how the baby was coming out. At first I tried with vague, non specific responses. But they weren’t doing it for him. He kept bringing it up, again and again.</description>

      <description>I don’t remember what magazine or book I read it from, but a few years ago I found an idea for having a wise man celebration. For some reason I recall it being on January 6th. And I decided it was a good idea. But that year my entire family got struck with the stomach virus, so we skipped it. But last year and this year we celebrated, thus making it a tradition at our house.</description>

      <description>Much like the decorating of the pumpkin, the constructing of the gingerbread house didn’t happen according to the traditional time line. We here at the circus like to do things in our own time, thank you very much!
I mentioned before that this year I decided to go with the kit over baking from scratch. I bought the kit in early December and kept waiting for that evening when we were all home and not already busy with something else.</description>

      <description>I often don’t bother scrambling around the house looking for shoes before heading out the door. We give a good attempt, but if we’re running late, I bank on the fact that we’ll be able to find a pair in the van.
One afternoon when my husband asked where to find my daughter’s shoe and I told him, these are what he found on the floor of our van (and believe it or not, there are more that just didn’t fit into the shot).</description>

      <description>Our beloved pooch turns 6 today! Where does the time go? We got her two weeks after moving into our new home and before we had kids. One of my fourth grade language arts students loved corgi’s and did a book report on Pembrooke Welsh Corgi’s. He got an A and I was sold on Corgi’s. I distinctly remember him telling me that they were “light shedders and good with kids.</description>

      <description>2008 was a good year at the Circus.
In February, I was blessed with a new niece. You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have known this though because I didn&amp;rsquo;t begin blogging until the end of March. The spring was also filled with fun family activities like going to a real circus, celebrating Easter, and watching the Blue Angels. Summer held a trip to the beach, patriotic celebrations, my birthday, camping, sailboat races, and a reunion with friends.</description>

I just had to share some more candid gems because they just warmed my heart and I feel my hubby did a great job of capturing the love and fun of our day together.
We all had lunch together on Sunday and afterwards the youngest two of our crews took naps while everyone else enjoyed a relaxing afternoon of play.</description>

      <description>Christmas provides you with many gems&amp;hellip;photos which capture the moment, in real life. Nothing like posing in front of the tree to bring out the true personality of your child.
Yes&amp;hellip; this is def what I meant when I said , &amp;ldquo;Smile in front of the camera so Mom can have a picture of you in your nice church clothes.&amp;rdquo;

I love this pic&amp;hellip; I am entitling it Christmas bliss&amp;hellip; I love that it is not posed.</description>

      <description>2 days before Christmas, Scott was talking with our son and he mentioned how he asked Santa for a remote control Lighting Mcqueen car.
OK here&amp;rsquo;s a slight problem because we hadn&amp;rsquo;t gotten him a remote control one. I had just gotten him a little matchbox size mcqueen car for his stocking (because Santa does the stockings at our house).
So, I went out to Target on Christmas Eve to try to find a remote control Lighting Mcqueen car, with no such luck.</description>

Apparently, it is an unwritten rule in our house that when you eat Jesus&#39; birthday cake, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to use silverware.

      <description>After dressing the children in their finest, and forcing them to pose for pictures in front of the tree, we went to church this evening for the Christmas Eve services.
When one of our pastors got up to read Scripture, he said he would be reading from John 1. My son leaned over to me and said, &amp;ldquo;Mom, I thought the story was in Luke 2.&amp;quot; This was probably one of my favorite quotes from the evening.</description>

      <description>Isn&amp;rsquo;t it amazing how something so simple can trigger a memory so deep? You hear a song from your past and suddenly you can feel all those emotions and feelings you felt so long ago&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s like it just propels you back in time.
Yea&amp;hellip; Faith Hill does that to me.
When Scott and I were dating in college, I spent one memorable Thanksgiving at his family&amp;rsquo;s home. That evening we were sitting around the dining room table playing Rummikub when I remembered that the Faith Hill TV special was on that evening, and I commented on that fact.</description>

When we left the house we were deciding between a trip to Hersheypark or the local train garden and drive through light display. Basically, we were looking for a fun evening out enjoying some holiday cheer. As we were driving, we got the idea of going into DC to see the National Christmas Tree.</description>

      <description>As we were getting ready to go to the tree lighting ceremony downtown my son asked, &amp;ldquo;Mom, can I tell Santa that he is not what Christmas is all about?&amp;quot;
I love that as we anticipate Christmas, my kids know that we are preparing to celebrate Jesus&#39; birth. Yes, they know we are going to have presents under the tree, and they even sat on Santa&amp;rsquo;s lap at Scott&amp;rsquo;s work party, but when I asked my son what he likes best about Christmas, he answered, &amp;ldquo;celebrating Jesus&#39; birthday.</description>

      <description>When I was little if you wanted to make my mom mad, all you had to do was ask her who was visiting when she was cleaning house. Oh how I remember the look she&amp;rsquo;d get on her face when I would say that&amp;hellip;.seems my turn has come&amp;hellip;

After decorating our cookies yesterday, I realized it was time to deep clean my kitchen. Once I scrubbed down the icing covered counter, it only made me realize how scummy the other counters looked.</description>

      <description>After years of research in my test kitchen, I have found that Krusteaz sugar cookie mix tastes better than any of the &amp;ldquo;from scratch sugar cookies&amp;rdquo; I have made.
And not only do they taste good, but literally, you pour the mix, add water, and stir!!

This is crucial for me, because with my three preschoolers, Mommy needs to spend her time managing the flour and cutting out of the cookies, not measuring and mixing.</description>

      <description>The circus crew and I went to run some errands this morning&amp;hellip;Target and Michale&amp;rsquo;s were ok&amp;hellip; granted we did crack the sugar sprinkle container when the baby threw it on the floor, and my older daughter soon had the spilled sugar all over her face and hands after &amp;ldquo;sampling it&amp;rdquo; but we only got a few looks when the kids were singing jingle bells as they hung off the side of the cart while I finished my shopping.</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip;you start spelling anything you don&amp;rsquo;t want others to over hear.
Case in point&amp;hellip;
Scott and I had parked the car in a crowded parking garage recently, and I knew better than to shout, &amp;ldquo;Hey Honey did you lock the car?&amp;rdquo;
So, without even thinking, I said, &amp;ldquo;Scott, don&amp;rsquo;t forget to L-O-C-K the van!&amp;rdquo;
But, unlike the preschoolers at home who I am accustomed to spelling around if I don&amp;rsquo;t want them to figure out what I am saying, MOST thieves can spell.</description>

      <description>I am one happy girl tonight.
Why, you ask?
** The Steelers beat the Ravens **&amp;hellip; and if that wasn&amp;rsquo;t reason enough to rejoice, doing so clinched them a spot in the play offs AND a first round bye.
I had a realization about myself while watching the game though. I don&amp;rsquo;t really enjoy watching the game unless we are winning. Really. I was literally sick to my stomach with worry for much of the game.</description>

      <description>I mentioned before that Scott and I have been spending a great deal of thought, prayer, and discussion lately on a few big family decisions.
1. How will we educate our son next year?
I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it, but my oldest will be ready to start kindergarten next year. Since he was only months old, I&amp;rsquo;ve been hounded with questions from friends, family, and acquaintances about where we will send him to school.</description>

      <description>One of my favorite Christmas traditions is cutting down our tree. I absolutely love having a real tree. The rush of choosing just the right one to bring home is such fun. I also really like that no tree looks exactly alike or perfect. We&amp;rsquo;ve had a few that we&amp;rsquo;ve brought home and thought&amp;hellip;.&amp;ldquo;Ooo, didn&amp;rsquo;t realize it was crooked at the farm.&amp;rdquo; The imperfections always add to the charm though.</description>

      <description>My first memories of making a gingerbread house are at my high school friend Katie&amp;rsquo;s birthday party. It became a tradition. Each year her mom would bake the houses and make the icing and supply all the candy. We&amp;rsquo;d all come over for her birthday in December to decorate our houses. It was a ton of fun! We&amp;rsquo;d sit and talk, sneak candy and decorate our houses. I believe we made an all night affair out of it.</description>

      <description>My son often refers to Santa as Saint Nicholas. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s because of reading Jolly Old Saint Nicholas and Twas the Night Before Christmas.
This week my son decided he wanted to pretend to be Saint Nicholas.
Meet Jolly Old Saint Nick himself&amp;hellip;

Check out his sleigh (the blanket&amp;hellip;see him holding the reigns?) and note the stuffed bear playing the roll of reindeer.

      <description>Update: This round of playoffs takes two weeks. So the winner is decided by totaling the points scored both weeks, and whoever scored the most points goes on to the championship round. Looks like a close one&amp;hellip;Scott scored 80 and I had 76. There is def still time for me to pull out a victory!!
There are 10 teams on our fantasy football league this year. Four teams make it to play offs.</description>

      <description>My father in law graduated from the Naval Academy, so I became a Navy fan by marriage. And the biggest game of the year for them is the Army/Navy game.
Knowing this, you might better appreciate the conversation I had with my son yesterday&amp;hellip;
 Mom: Tomorrow is the Army/Navy football game
Son: Army doesn&amp;rsquo;t play football, they fight bad guys
Hmmm see he&amp;rsquo;s seen Navy football games with his Dad and Pop, and all he knows about the Army is that his Uncle Jim and our cousin Joel are in the Army and they fight bad guys&amp;hellip;better clear up this misconception before he goes around saying Navy plays football and Army fights bad guys&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>12 years ago Scott and I went on our first date. We went to dinner and then strolled around the shops in downtown Annapolis for midnight Madness.
I was so excited and nervous.
This was my first REAL date.
And what could be more romantic than strolling through historic Annapolis listening to Christmas carols?
Even though we didn&amp;rsquo;t hold hands, (That didn&amp;rsquo;t come until February). I was still on cloud nine.</description>

If you notice, there is a Christmas tree in the background here. Every week my family did an advent devotional on Sunday evenings. We&amp;rsquo;d read a passage of Scripture, light the candle and sing some Christmas carols.</description>

      <description>Today I spent my &amp;ldquo;down time&amp;rdquo; working on some Christmas projects which needed to be finished so I could get them ordered and shipped. Then, I went about figuring out our Christmas card and ordering them.
Because, No&amp;hellip; I have not mailed my Christmas cards.
And until 5 minutes ago, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t even ordered them from Winkflash
Which means I have yet to address them or write our Christmas letter.</description>

Do we want to send our son to public school next year or will we home school?

It&amp;rsquo;s easy to see that a good time was had by all. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t my baby look like an oompa loompa? I gotta confess I had quite a few laughs at her expense watching her try to walk around in her big sisters boots and snow suit.</description>

But, come the day after Thanksgiving you better believe we are cranking those yuletide carols as loud as we can as we head out for some good ol&#39; fashioned Black Friday Shopping!
I LOVE CHRISTMAS!! It is by far my most favorite holiday of all.</description>

 Mommy and Daddy (yea, we made the list) his sisters (doesn&amp;rsquo;t this just warm your heart) toast ice cream  This list was quite insightful to me. Who know that toast got such high billing? I&amp;rsquo;ll be sure to have toast around more often now that I know how much he values it.</description>

The rest of us came out to hold rakes, snap pictures, and jump in huge piles. Daddy was the one still raking in the cold all by himself when everyone else when inside to warm up and take naps. Yea, I know my husband rocks.

$14.00, he replied.

But, my daughter has never been to school.
And everything she knows about school, she learned from watching her big brother.
So when we &amp;ldquo;play school&amp;rdquo; it goes something like this&amp;hellip;
My daughter takes her booster seat down from the table and sets it up in the hall to be her &amp;ldquo;car seat&amp;rdquo;. She then has me strap her in and drive her to school.</description>

1. Happy Kids
2. Setting sun
3. Fall leaves
However, we forgot the photographer.
After frolicking along the path gathering leaves and sticks, I noticed that the suns rays were really quite beautiful. I remembered Scott saying that one of the best times of days to get pictures is before sunset.</description>

      <description>Crafty, I am not. But, I was an elementary education major, so I do know how to use scissors and glue. And, I have found that I really enjoy doing simple arts and crafts projects with my children.
But, the circus life can get rather busy. And as with most things, if I am not intentional, the opportunities and the moments pass me by.
So, this year I have designated Tuesday as &amp;ldquo;Crafty Tuesday.</description>

      <description>Sunday my husband and I had plans during the Steelers games. Thankfully we have a DVR, so we just recorded the game to watch when we got home. This has happened before, and we have devised a sort of routine for situations like this, because it would be AWFUL to accidentally find out the results of the game before we watched it. So, we typically race into the house (because what if we see a neighbor and they casually mention the game) we then unplug the phone (because what if a friend or family member calls to talk about it) and we don&amp;rsquo;t turn on the computer (because what if someone e-mailed about it or we saw something on our &amp;ldquo;igoogle headline&amp;rdquo; (since we have Steelers websites in our favorites on our home page.</description>

      <description>The Safeway near us closed down for the past year so they could tear it down and build a bigger, more modern grocery store. I must say I am pretty excited about this because now I don&amp;rsquo;t have to drive as far to get my groceries.
Perhaps, I got a little too excited.
When I got the flier in the mail about their &amp;ldquo;grand opening preview party&amp;rdquo; on Thursday night, I started making plans.</description>

Well, wait no longer&amp;hellip;
It only took 18 mths for us to bring our son on his first national park trip.
Much like the beginning of our first trip, this pose was quite normal. Here we are in Acadia National Park.
 The next summer we had a two and half year old and a 7 month old.</description>

      <description>Trekking out and about about with a toddler can be tricky enough, but running errands with a potty training toddler, her into everything ever curious, little sister and her energetic older brother is down right difficult. Those bathroom stalls were not meant for four people! But what do you do when your potty training toddler has to go and hasn&amp;rsquo;t learned how to hold it?
This genius idea is courtesy of my dear friend Rebecca.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a show on Disney which my kids really liked for awhile, but it just didn&amp;rsquo;t sit right with my husband and I. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing morally objectionable in it. It&amp;rsquo;s just a silly little cartoon. My concern lies with the fact that it seems to trivialize the word hero. Ever seen Higglytown Heroes? In each story the main characters find themselves in a situation which needs help from a higglytown hero (a local community person doing their job) It might be the locksmith, the veterinarian, or the barbershop owner.</description>

      <description>Who would ever thought soccer cleats could be so cute? When I took my son to get his cleats at the beginning of the season, I thought those cleats were far cuter than any baby bootie I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen. I&amp;rsquo;ve never been into bronzing the baby shoes, but I will be tucking these cleats away in a box to look at years from now when I complain of the big stinky cleats I find sitting in my doorway.</description>

      <description>A recent dinner conversation resulted in one of those, &amp;ldquo;wow&amp;rdquo; moments for my husband and I as we listened to our four year old speak truths that truly made us rejoice.
We had been talking about voting and my husband asked if my four year old son new what voting was&amp;hellip;
 Son: Yea I do I learned it at school&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s the government who makes all the rules
Dad: Right&amp;hellip; and we get to vote on who will make those rules</description>

      <description>Ladies, I have truly enjoyed reading your comments about how your husbands rock. It was probably my most exciting blog week to date. I can&amp;rsquo;t tell you how much it brightened my day to read such uplifting words about your hubbies. I want to encourage all of you to tell your husbands why they rock. Today. Don&amp;rsquo;t assume they know. Don&amp;rsquo;t figure they don&amp;rsquo;t need to hear it. Don&amp;rsquo;t wait for them to tell you why you rock first.</description>

      <description>We didn&amp;rsquo;t get to carving pumpkins this year. The kids each got to pick a pumpkin at our field trip to the petting farm, and while they were quite content with this size of their pumpkins, they weren&amp;rsquo;t exactly jack-o-lantern material. I am sure we&amp;rsquo;d have had to pay a trip to the ER if we attempted to carve such small pumpkins. I kept holding out for a trip to a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; pumpkin patch, but it just wasn&amp;rsquo;t in the cards this year.</description>

Because we are scrapbook geeks or maybe just geeks, we decided it would be fun to pose in front of each national park sign.
At first we posed like normal people, you know arm around each other all cute and coupley&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>We may not always agree with Obama&amp;rsquo;s view on the roll of government but, regardless of where we stand politically, this truly is a huge and monumental milestone for our country. My husband was reading on BBC.com this morning and sent me an e-mail with some quotes and thoughts that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t fully considered. I thought they were worth sharing.
 &amp;quot; On 28 August 1963, Martin Luther King spoke of his dream for America, with the brooding statue of Abraham Lincoln offering the most glorious of pulpits.</description>

      <description>I voted today. For some reason this year more than any other, I was grateful for the opportunity to let my voice be heard. Often I am rather cynical about it, voting because I know it is the right thing to do but wondering &amp;ldquo;why bother&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Does my vote really matter anyway?&amp;rdquo;
But today I felt convicted.
There was a time in American history when woman couldn&amp;rsquo;t vote and there are many countries today where women still can&amp;rsquo;t vote.</description>

      <description>Being a self proclaimed non dog lover and a mother of three preschoolers, I must admit that the dog is not high on the priority list. Her needs sadly get ignored all too often.
I honestly couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell you that last time poor Maggie had a bath.
But, in the interest of keeping it real, I&amp;rsquo;d say it was at least last spring.
So, today I decided to give her a bath.</description>

      <description>How often do you plan something special just for your hubbie? No, not your anniversary or his birthday, but just because you love him?
While I was at the MOPS convention last month, there was a woman there promoting The Husband Project. Curious, I stopped by her booth. The husband project is basically a guideline for helping wives to focus on their husbands needs. The project is designed to last for 3 weeks.</description>

I do not heart Mondays. AT.ALL. And my reasons why are numerous, so numerous, I&amp;rsquo;ve composed a list for you.
 Scott is back to work and after having him home for 2 days, I miss him. LOTS. Because he is truly my best friend and the house is lonely with him gone. I know we are only 29 but can I just tell you I look forward to retirement when we can spend all day every day just being together&amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t even care what it is we are doing, just that we won&amp;rsquo;t be a part.</description>

Our neighborhood has two days of trick or treating&amp;hellip;because one night of filling your pumpkin with candy just isn&amp;rsquo;t enough. The shopping plaza in our neighborhood hosts a trick or treating event every year the day before Halloween. It feels like a celebration right out of Gilmore Girls as we stroll from store to store getting candy. It&amp;rsquo;s become a sort of tradition for us to visit Scott&amp;rsquo;s parents and grandparents after this so they can see them in their costumes.</description>

      <description>Last month the topic of our MOPS (Mothers of PreSchoolers) meeting was patience. As we shared in our discussion groups, one mom shared a verse that she had read which had really helped her control her anger.
James 1:20
&amp;ldquo;for man&amp;rsquo;s anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires.&amp;quot;
When she read the verse every mom around the table sat up. &amp;ldquo;Woa, that&amp;rsquo;s a good one, where is it?</description>

      <description>My son told me he knew what I should wear on a tee shirt. He came up with this slogan out of the blue the other day.
&amp;ldquo;I run like a mommy and my kids cheer all the time when I run
and my husband works so good like a dad, he&amp;rsquo;s awesome!&amp;quot;
I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly sure what it means to run like a Mommy.
But after recently receiving the photos from the race photographers, I realized that I learned a valuable lesson at my A10 race which I applied when running my half marathon.</description>

      <description>This week the assignment for THAT Family&amp;rsquo;s carnival, was to post a scary pic from the past. So, I started looking through some old Halloween photos trying to find just the right one&amp;hellip;
I was never much into scary, though I did sport a mask in this costume when I was 4 or 5.

My son however, seems to take the prize for his scary costumes&amp;hellip;
Here he is at 6 mths sporting his ferocious dragon attire.</description>

      <description>I cracked up laughing when they came down the hall like this. Don&amp;rsquo;t they look like a couple of bank robbers? The best part is that later that week when I went to put this pair of underwear on my son, he told me, &amp;ldquo;Mom, I can&amp;rsquo;t wear these, they are my mask!&amp;rdquo;

      <description>Isn&amp;rsquo;t she a cutie? I&amp;rsquo;m embarrassed to admit that twice in the last week I took my poor baby girl out in these shoes. Yea&amp;hellip; go ahead take a closer look incase you missed it at first. Same style, but ummm different color. The first was on a Sunday morning. I was doing that mad dash for the door b/c we were already going to be late and I was literally just grabbing whatever shoe I could find with hopes that by the time I reached the door I&amp;rsquo;d have at least one match in my hand (and banking on that fact that if I didn&amp;rsquo;t, the other half would be waiting in the van).</description>

      <description>As my kids were getting ready for their bath the other night the following conversation took place.
 Sister: What&amp;rsquo;s that? (she&amp;rsquo;s pointing at his nipple)
Brother: It&amp;rsquo;s the thing you guys (pause) girls have to give babies milk when they don&amp;rsquo;t use bottles.
 I know that I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be, but I am continually amazed by how much the information kids absorb just by watching the world around them, and how much they remember!</description>

 Me: Wow, your hair is getting long and so pretty
Daughter: No I&amp;rsquo;m not
Me: Why not? What do you want it to be?
Daughter: I want to be nice and kind.
(My son starts giggling at this point)
Me: Hmmm that&amp;rsquo;s good, but you can be nice and kind and still have pretty hair.</description>

I wish I could tell you that we staged the video because I just thought it would be so funny for you to see my kids fighting with each other while I am videoing.</description>

She might have been little, but she could hold her own. Check out the grip on her trick or treating pumpkin. And the look on that face says, &amp;ldquo;No body go near my loot!&amp;rdquo; This isn&amp;rsquo;t a damsel in distress kind of princess; she can handle things herself, thank you very much.</description>

      <description>Last week the kids and I were looking for something fun to do during that difficult time of day between nap time and dinner. We went in the yard to collect some leaves for leaf rubbings and I got another idea of what to do with the leaves when we were finished with our rubbings.
We gathered leaves of various colors and types from the yard. I then took some strips of clear contact paper and peeled the backing off of the contact paper, leaving it sticky side up on the table.</description>

 Son: Mom, can I see a real brain some day?
Me: You want to see grain?
Son: No a BRAIN
pause (and I had been trying to figure out where to find grain&amp;hellip;if only&amp;hellip;)
Me: I don&amp;rsquo;t think so, that would be pretty tough
Son: Well, if someone died and then we cut their head open, then we could see what their brain looked like</description>

      <description>Most scrapbooks include pictures of baby&amp;rsquo;s first steps, first food, first drink from a sippy cup&amp;hellip; but where do you put the picture of the first time baby ripped the wallpaper border above her crib? 
In our house it&amp;rsquo;s become a sort of right of passage.
Thank goodness we had lots of extra border from the first time we did the nursery. Poor Winnie the Pooh has been ripped 3 different times!</description>

Our day begins here typically around 7 am or shortly after. My son is usually the first to wake, followed quickly by our middle child.</description>

      <description>Yea, so let me explain my absence&amp;hellip;
I must confess Friday night was more laziness than anything else, as I started a post, still have it in my draft, but the creative juices weren&amp;rsquo;t flowing like I wanted so I opted to read a book and go to bed early (as in before midnight) to get ready for my BIG morning&amp;hellip;

I ran in the Baltimore Half Marathon.</description>

I started a brief summary in pictures of my weekend&amp;rsquo;s activities 2 hours ago, but then 5 phone calls and 3 kids up from there naps later and I am still left with this&amp;hellip;.
yea, so&amp;hellip;. I am now feeding my kids some scrambled eggs and then am off to drop my kids off at a friend&amp;rsquo;s and head to set up for our MOPS meeting tonight&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>My oldest two kids and I decided to commemorate the beautiful fall weather this week, by making our very first scare crow. Because we don&amp;rsquo;t live on a farm and straw is horribly overpriced in these city parts, we opted to stuff our scare crow girl with leaves. We built her during our baby&amp;rsquo;s nap time, but she woke just in time to watch us put the finishing touches on her.</description>

      <description>My recent trip to Dallas, prompted me to bring home some cowboy/girl hats for my kiddos and as I snapped pictures of them playing dress up, I was reminded of some pictures from my past which look very similar.
In the picture below, I am on a riding horse with a cowgirl like hat at around 17 mths&amp;hellip; a mere 2 mths older than my baby girl. Like the old Polaroid picture?</description>

      <description>Our College has an alumni book which they publish quarterly. In the back is a section where they put baby pics of the alumni&amp;rsquo;s children (wearing their GCC shirts of course).
When our son was born we were so excited to contact the school and get our tee shirt. I remember taking the picture when he was around 10 mths old. Our hard drive crashed the next day and while we did eventually get all the pictures back, when we did that GCC pic was no longer in the fore front of my mind.</description>

      <description>Ya know the kids song, &amp;ldquo;Father Abraham&amp;rdquo;? It&amp;rsquo;s typically popular with Sunday School and VBS kids everywhere. When I taught third grade it was a fav of my students.
Not such a hit with my four year old. I&amp;rsquo;ve said he&amp;rsquo;s analytical, and he proved that point.
We&amp;rsquo;re driving along in the minivan listening to a Kids Praise CD when &amp;ldquo;Father Abraham&amp;rdquo; comes on. I&amp;rsquo;m singing along in my head not really paying much attention when my son asks, &amp;ldquo;Why does it say I am one of them?</description>

      <description>I had a great time this past weekend in Dallas. I learned TONS as I was challenged, inspired, and encouraged. I also had just good ol&#39; fun&amp;hellip;shopping, dining out, staying up late chatting with my girlfriends, singing karaoke&amp;hellip; (yes, you read that correctly, funny how oddly comfortable, perhaps too comfortable you can feel in a room full of mommies late at night).
Thanks for stopping by and reading my first ever guest post.</description>

      <description>What a delightful two days it&amp;rsquo;s been. Tiring, for sure. But also delightful. Crystal often talks of juggling her roles and I now firmly believe she couldn&amp;rsquo;t be doing it any better.
This was my first time playing the role of Aunt Karen and part-time mom.
And I now know first hand that Circus couldn&amp;rsquo;t be a better analogy. Things I&amp;rsquo;ve observed&amp;hellip;.

This is a very ORGANIZED circus.</description>

Here we are enjoying our first dinner in our apartment&amp;hellip; yup that would be frozen pizza and champagne. We had just flown in from our honeymoon in St Lucia (you can see the unopened wedding presents behind us).</description>

      <description>That&amp;rsquo;s right folks, tomorrow Mommy is out of here till Sunday morning. I&amp;rsquo;m packing my bags and flying to Dallas for the MOPS Convention. And while I am really excited at the opportunity to grow as I listen to great speakers and attend workshops, I am also sad to be away from my hubby and kiddos for almost 3 full days. I know from past experience that when I get there I will have a great time as I am listening to live music, eating dinner out with my friends (experiencing uninterrupted adult conversations for 9 meals), and learning from dynamic speakers.</description>

      <description>Look who&amp;rsquo;s facing forward now!
(Yes, I know she&amp;rsquo;s been legal for 2 mths now, but I read somewhere it was technically safer to face backwards as long as possible, so we delayed turning her around).

Her response, &amp;ldquo;Hey! Where&amp;rsquo;d my brother and sister go? Now I have to stare at the back of Mommy and Daddy&amp;rsquo;s head!&amp;rdquo;

We are so psyched! It is probably my favorite game of the year. If there&amp;rsquo;s anything I enjoy watching more than the Steelers win, it&amp;rsquo;s watching them win against the Ravens. Here&amp;rsquo;s hoping for a good game!! Go STEELERS!!!</description>

International Talk Like a Pirate Day.
I was quite proud of myself this week when I finished buying my kids their Halloween costumes. I mean it isn&amp;rsquo;t even October yet, and we&amp;rsquo;ve got the Spiderman, Princess, and Lady Bug bought and hanging in the closet.</description>

      <description>Last week in our Catechism Class, I taught the kids the song &amp;ldquo;This Little Light of Mine.&amp;rdquo; We talked about how we can let our lights shine and how we can hide our light. We played a game where I would name some actions (like obeying your parents, or hitting your sister) and then the kids had to say if that action let their light shine or covered it up. (They got to turn the flashlight off or on when it was their turn to answer the question).</description>

      <description>Our two year old as gotten quite attached to her baby doll. She mothers her in all sorts of ways.
She reads her stories at nap time.

And arranges a spot for her (and almost every one of her stuffed animals) to sleep beside her at nap time.

She gives her a nebulizer treatment because she had a bad cough.

She even started potty training her this week!</description>

      <description>Today is my husband&amp;rsquo;s grandma&amp;rsquo;s birthday. Sadly, she isn&amp;rsquo;t here to celebrate with us as the Lord took her home this past February.
I think of her often and miss her. She used to love to bump heads with our kids. She&amp;rsquo;d lean forward so their foreheads touched and say, &amp;ldquo;bump.&amp;rdquo; My youngest will do it from time to time with me and every time I think to myself, &amp;ldquo;Grandma would have loved that!</description>

      <description>I gotta confess from the start, this is not quite Wordless.

As I was tidying up the house during nap time this week, I found this in my kitchen. I bent down to pick them up and decided to snap a quick picture first. Because some day, my kids will be grown and in school, and I won&amp;rsquo;t find half dressed baby dolls lying on the floor beside toy guns with my vacuum attachment stuck on top to turn it into a light saber.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago my hubby and I were shopping for a big purchase. We aren&amp;rsquo;t the type to make big purchases on the fly. They require lots of research and thinking and looking and more research then finally purchasing. Cameras, cars, computers, TV&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; they&amp;rsquo;re all the same drill.
But with three kids under 4, it&amp;rsquo;s not quite as easy as it used to be.
We made two trips to the store in one weekend and I totally felt like a traveling circus.</description>

Our Master Bedroom
The bedroom is supposed to be a place of calm and relaxation&amp;hellip;where you can rest&amp;hellip;a place of rest and rejuvenation. I read somewhere that you should decorate it with things that are sentimental and special to the two of you, a place that is yours as a couple.</description>

      <description>Our church has a catechism class for 4-9 year olds that meets weekly on Sunday evenings. This year I will be co-teaching my sons class on the beginning catechism. Throughout the course of the year he will work to memorize the first 48 questions in the Westminster Shorter Catechism.
I am really excited about this because the catechism provides an easy way to teach and remember vital Biblical truths.
For example here are the first five catechism questions.</description>

      <description>We took the kids to the county fair last week. Being the suburbanites that we are my kids don&amp;rsquo;t get many opportunities to see livestock up close and personal, so we make a point of going every fall to see the cows, ducks, chickens, goats, sheep, and pigs. Since we don&amp;rsquo;t exactly live in the country, it&amp;rsquo;s not quite as big as I&amp;rsquo;m sure some county fairs are, but a fun learning experience none the less.</description>

I had seen my 2 year old daughter over by the counter asking about the bread, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t pay that much attention.</description>

      <description>My kids have a fascination with poop.
(Have no fear no pictures included in this post)!
Every time we change our baby&amp;rsquo;s diaper, the older two want to know if it is poop and if it is they want to see it.
As odd as it is to us, it seems like an easy and harmless enough wish to comply with that my husband and I know &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t throw the diaper into the pail until you&amp;rsquo;ve held it up for all to see.</description>

      <description>This Thursday I began a new year of Bible Study with an organization called BSF. One of the biggest reasons I chose this study over others is that it has a children&amp;rsquo;s program unlike any other I&amp;rsquo;ve seen. My kids will be going through a preschool curriculum based on the same study I will be doing. I am so excited about talking with my older two children about what we are learning each week.</description>

      <description>My son is an individual. Despite the fact that his parents are crazy football fans and could care less about baseball, he decided when he was about 2 that he loved baseball. He&amp;rsquo;d willingly sit and watch it on TV. We&amp;rsquo;ve even Tivoed a few games for him or let him watch portions of Sports Center. We&amp;rsquo;ve taken him to a few minor league games in the past, but tonight we took our oldest two children to their first Major League Baseball Game.</description>

      <description>My 2 year old daughter loves Sesame Street.
Except for this guy.

Every time he comes on the screen, she does this.

or this.

The first time he scared her, I came into the room to find her laying face down on the couch crying. I asked her what was wrong and she said, &amp;ldquo;Cookie Monster yelled at me!&amp;rdquo; I think she really thought he was yelling at her when he was screaming for his cookies.</description>

      <description>Many of you know, that my hubby and I are big Pittsburgh Steelers fans. Sadly, many of the games are not televised here. We didn&amp;rsquo;t want to miss the big opening game on Sunday, so we took the kids to Glory Days restaurant to watch the game.
My hubby and I were a little nervous about how well this would go down. How would we keep 3 kids entertained sitting at a restaurant table for 3 hours?</description>

Friday was my son&amp;rsquo;s first day of preschool and at his school the teachers and administrators come to your vehicle to get your kid out in the morning and drop him off at pick up.</description>

I crossed yet another mommy milestone this weekend.
First came the diaper bag&amp;hellip;.no longer could I leave the house with nothing but my purse, leaving the house suddenly entailed making sure I had diapers wipes, spare clothes, pacifiers, toys, bibs, the kitchen sink&amp;hellip;. then came child two and mysteriously the diaper bag actually shrank as I realized I don&amp;rsquo;t&#39; need everything on those lists in the new mommy books&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t typically attempt this task on my own. Not since baby number 2 arrived anyway. But my husband had to work that day and it had to be done, so the task was left to me. And my three kids.
I pulled into the parking lot of our vet&amp;rsquo;s office, put both girls in the stroller, grabbed the dog leash, and had instructed my son to walk beside the stroller.</description>

      <description>Here is what happens when you let your two year old go swimming without one of those handy, dandy swimmy diapers. We brought one along on our trip to the pond this weekend, but didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like going through the effort of taking off her bathing suit and changing her diaper.
&amp;ldquo;How much water will the diaper collect, anyway?&amp;rdquo; We naively thought.

Apparently, these Luvs diapers can hold quite a bit.</description>

      <description>Even though the Steelers don&amp;rsquo;t play until Sunday afternoon, football season kicked off in our house last night. We had our Live Draft for our Fantasy Football League last night.
The kids were in bed a half hour before their bed time tonight with no story or teeth brushing as we had a 7:45 draft time and were both scurrying to research and formulate our plans right up until it started.</description>

Chick-Fil-A and Football. :-)
Today, Chick-Fil-A is giving away their new chicken strips (which, by the way, are delicious, and my hubby and my new fav menu item) to anyone who visits their store wearing a football logo. Check it out here for more details.
You better believe that all 5 of us will be sporting our Steelers pride at Chick-Fil-A today when we stop for lunch on our way back from our annual Labor Day get together.</description>

I realized this week how much I take that little toe for granted. Until it started hurting, I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize the impact one little phalange could have on the entire body. (I also didn&amp;rsquo;t realize how many times a day my feet are stepped on by my kids).</description>

      <description>Here are the top 10 reasons why my family loves to go camping.
10. It&amp;rsquo;s cheaper than a hotel
($20 a night versus $150 a night)
9. Smores!

8. It ensures that the ground will get the water its been deprived of all summer long.

7. Beautiful views

6. Togetherness

(look how cozy our beds look in there&amp;hellip;we almost always wake with at least one kiddo snuggled up next to us)</description>

The funny thing about this is that when I saw the assignment I thought to myself, &amp;ldquo;how lucky for me I just cleaned the van out last week when we got back from camping.</description>

You were positive you were going to marry your high school sweetheart&amp;hellip; When I was in high school my friends and I dreamed of growing up, getting married, and living in the same neighborhood.
While that dream didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly pan out, our friendship has remained strong. And 5 of the 6 of us actually went on and married our high school boyfriends.</description>

      <description>Despite the fact that I lack a green thumb and raise suicidal plants, I still attempted a garden this summer with my kids. Some may call me a hopeless optimist, to others I am just naive. But, my oldest two children were particularly excited about this new venture and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to let them down.
This April we planted a row of peas, a row of green beans, a row of pumpkins, two tomato plants, and two pepper plants.</description>

      <description>Sorry for not posting a post race synopsis yesterday, in the words of my dear sister in law, I was &amp;ldquo;too tired.&amp;rdquo;
 The race was a blast! The weather was gorgeous and the views were beautiful. My favorite was running down Main Street in Annapolis looking down at the harbor. It was incredible! The first 5 miles I felt great. I kept up a steady conversation with Karen and at each mile marker would scream out with glee.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve sung along to these lyrics dozens of times as I drove along in my minivan. But when I was running last week and this song came through my headphones, they hit me unlike any other time. God loves me, Crystal, more than the sun and the stars. As I listened to the words, I just imagined my Creator singing them to me and I was overwhelmed that He would chose to love me, wretched sinner that I am.</description>

      <description>My son was so excited about the favor we brought home from my friend&amp;rsquo;s wedding a few weeks ago. They gave out old fashioned root beer in bottles with a home made label. It was his first soda and he was so excited to drink &amp;ldquo;kid beer&amp;rdquo; as he called it.




I think he liked the idea of it more than the actual taste. He actually drank most of it the next day when it was flat.</description>

Our trip to Steelers training camp last week was one of the most eventful family car trips we&amp;rsquo;ve had in a long while. It was supposed to take 4 hrs to get to Latrobe, instead 6 hrs after we left we finally pulled into our camping space.</description>

      <description>My hubby and I are huge Pittsburgh Steelers fans. I was born a Steelers fan. My husband&amp;rsquo;s allegiance was born in college when he began faithfully watching the home team in Western, PA. There&amp;rsquo;s no way to distinguish who is more devoted now, we are both hard core. Living in Ravens territory is tough. We watch every game televised here, head to Glory Days for big games that aren&amp;rsquo;t televised, make a few treks to my parents house in PA, read the play by plays online, listen on the radio&amp;hellip;.</description>

When I was pregnant with my son I developed an irrational fear of driving. I was driving over a bridge one day and felt light headed, which triggered a complete panic attack. After that I had trouble driving the 5 miles to work each day. My dear husband and sympathetic friends taxied me around for a few months.</description>

      <description>Wednesday was one of those days. I heard my baby fussing from her nap so I went in to get her. I knew when I approached the door she needed her diaper changed. It was that smelly.
However, when I went to pick her up, I was surprised to discover her diaper didn&amp;rsquo;t do it&amp;rsquo;s job. (and unlike last time, there really was a diaper there, it just didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to hold the goods)!</description>

The other day when she handed &amp;ldquo;baby doll&amp;rdquo; to me because she was &amp;ldquo;sick&amp;rdquo; I took a good look at my old doll.</description>

After suffering the sick feeling of panic in my stomach and running around like a crazy mama I heard her crying. She had fallen down during her frolic and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see her in the tall grass.</description>

      <description>Applying Sunday&amp;rsquo;s lesson this week has been quite a joy. I&amp;rsquo;ve started each day by working on a lesson from Beth Moore&amp;rsquo;s Bible study of the Psalms of Ascent. Some mornings I did it in bed before ever leaving my room. Other mornings, I was working on it on the couch with a kid snuggled on my lap. Either way, it was the beginning of my day and it helped me to get my focus in the correct place.</description>

      <description>My hubby and I had the sad realization the other day that we aren&amp;rsquo;t as good of parents as we thought we were. See our son is 4 years old and we haven&amp;rsquo;t taught him to ride a bike or to swim.
So, we decided it was time to get the boy a bike.
Hubby thought a consignment shop was a good idea, because why spend a butt load of money when you don&amp;rsquo;t have to.</description>

      <description>Some may call it a sickness.
Others may think of me more as a loyalist.
It all stems back to an experience I had as a middle schooler.
Who knew that a trip to the grocery store could have such a lasting impact on a girl?
I was shopping with my mom one day when I was an early teen and they were conducting a blind taste test for Coke and Pepsi.</description>

      <description>This weekend my husband and my son went away for a Father/Son camping trip. More pics and details to follow later this week. For now, it&amp;rsquo;s girl time!!
 I stayed home with the two girls. We had a wonderful time playing and bonding. We baked chocolate chip cookies. Because a girl has got to have her chocolate fix, right?  And then to be completely stereotypical, I took them shopping at the mall.</description>

      <description>The Lord convicted me of something this morning at church and I had the urge to share it here on my blog, which is incredibly ironic when you read what it is I&amp;rsquo;m convicted about. Our pastor spoke to us about idols. He shared an idol that he frequently struggles with worshipping in place of God. See an idol doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be an object. It isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily a little gold man that you bow to.</description>

      <description>It seems the blogging world loves to play a good game of tag. I&amp;rsquo;ve received two tags in the past few weeks. So, for those of you looking for some Sunday reading here is way more than you could possibly want to know about little ol&#39; me!!

 Busy Mamas tagged me over a week ago with this Meme&amp;hellip; (Sorry Busy Mamas for taking so long to respond)!
Think back on the last 15 years of your life.</description>

      <description>When Scott and I were engaged everyone was reading this book. While we never sat down and read the book we did peruse the chapter headings to determine what the 5 love languages were and it didn&amp;rsquo;t take long for us to figure out which love language each of us spoke. We will both tell you that this is the best marriage book we ever didn&amp;rsquo;t read. The concepts in this book have truly helped our marriage.</description>

      <description>Thanks so much for your encouragement on Monday. I am happy to say that on Tuesday I ran 6 miles!! My dear husband has given me the gift of 6 songs to download to my MP3 player as an encouragement for completing this goal and to help me as I strive to make it the next 4 miles in the next 3 weeks. Here&amp;rsquo;s where you come in&amp;hellip;
I need your suggestions for great running songs.</description>

      <description>Scott and I see eye to eye on most things. When it comes to parenting though, we have one major disagreement&amp;hellip;
pajamas
I think they are cute and cuddly and so adorable.
Scott thinks they are impractical and a complete waste of time. &amp;quot;Why do we need to change them just to sleep,&amp;quot; He asks.
I have a hard time coming up with a real compelling reason.
&amp;quot;Because they look so cute in them,&amp;quot; is typically my reply.</description>

      <description>I was not an athlete growing up. I quit softball half way through my first season when I was 8 telling my dad, &amp;ldquo;I hate it. You get all sweaty and dirty and stuff!&amp;rdquo; (The fact that I had gotten hit in the face twice with a softball didn&amp;rsquo;t help either).

In eighth grade I found myself at a new school and decided to play lacrosse. My friends were all playing and it seemed like fun.</description>

      <description>Anyone want to guess what this picture shows&amp;hellip;.

That is the roof of our &amp;quot;white&amp;quot; Ford Escape. I guess you could say its been awhile since car washing made it to the top of the to-do list. You know it&amp;rsquo;s time to go it again when your kid hears the term &amp;lsquo;car wash&amp;rsquo; and responds with a giggle, &amp;quot;You can&amp;rsquo;t wash cars! That&amp;rsquo;s silly!&amp;quot; Ummm&amp;hellip;.yea&amp;hellip;the last time we washed our car this is what my son looked like.</description>

      <description>Updated&amp;hellip;for those those that asked Movie Review Below
I&amp;rsquo;m going on a hot date tonight with my hubby and I am SO excited!! My legs are shaved, eye brows plucked, and I&amp;rsquo;m even going to wear a skirt and put on make up!! Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll even add a little jewelry for sparkle!!
This time we aren&amp;rsquo;t going to Toys R Us! I got free movie tickets at the grocery store earlier this summer so thanks to Sarah&amp;rsquo;s raving review, we&amp;rsquo;re going to see the new Batman Movie and eating dinner too (one where we don&amp;rsquo;t have to cut food into tiny pieces, sop up spilled milk, AND we can even have a complete conversation)!</description>

      <description>I had a great post written &amp;quot;in my head&amp;quot; Saturday morning. I was setting off to do a 6 mile run. It would have been the longest run I had ever done in my life. Before training for the Annapolis 10 Mile that I am working towards at the end of the summer, the farthest I had run was a 5K (3.1 miles) So, this would have been about twice that.</description>

      <description>There were a few blogs I read regularly this winter before I started blogging myself. One of these is Confessions of a CF Husband. Nate and his wife Tricia have had an incredible year, filled with many scary and uncertain moments. It is obvious to me from reading their blogs that they love the Lord and they truly trust in His sovereign will for their lives. It is both humbling and inspiring to read about their journey.</description>

      <description>Ever play the game Mad Gab? One team holds up a card with a gibberish phrase and the other team has to translate it. Translating what my two year old says is a lot like playing this game.
Case in point, last week my daughter was teasing my mom. My mom wanted her to call her Grandma and she knew this so she would call her everything but that. As they looked each other in the eye their charade went something like this&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Since the day he was born, people have been telling me that my son looks like his Daddy. He&amp;rsquo;s been referred to as Scott 2.0 and Mini-Me. I don&amp;rsquo;t argue that there is no debating who his Daddy is, but I will say that he&amp;rsquo;s got my eyes.
Make that eye.

      <description>We have a tradition at our house that we do every day when Daddy comes home. I don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly when or how it started, but as soon as Maggie (our dog) barks to let us know he&amp;rsquo;s home, my older two children dash and hide. Daddy then has to find them. I&amp;rsquo;m sure the words, &amp;quot;Daddy&amp;rsquo;s home&amp;hellip;HIDE!&amp;quot; were just the words he longed to hear after a hard day of work, but he always plays along and looks &amp;quot;high and low&amp;quot; till he finds them and is greeting with smiles and giggles.</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t used to be a procrastinator, but now that I have 3 kids, I tend to take care of the urgent first. This means that sometimes my really good plans get altered when real life sets in. I have found that if I want to tackle a large project or extra thing (extra being not laundry, groceries, cleaning, cooking&amp;hellip; those necessities of life) I need to make a self-imposed deadline in order for it to happen.</description>

Well, I guess I am using this blog post as my quote board&amp;hellip; here are a few memorable ones from the past several weeks.

So, of course when I checked CNN.com to scan the headlines, I only had time for one article. Which article did this homebound mommy starved for information on life outside of the circus, click on?

      <description>When I spend time in nature, be it gazing at the waves crashing at the shore of the beach, beholding a mountain peak in all it&amp;rsquo;s might, or gazing at a star studded sky, each time, I feel compelled to worship my Maker. Spending the day at the zoo this week, was no different.
Watching the giraffe reach his long neck out to grab a leaf and witnessing a huge polar bear plunge into a pool of water both caused me to reflect on the Creator of the Universe.</description>

Where did this year go??? 
 Weekend Thoughts: My posts typically relate funny anecdotes about the happenings here at the circus. While my days are seldom “normal” enough to leave me without a “post worthy” moment, I use my last post of the week to highlight something a little more “thoughtful” and significant.</description>

My husband is horrible with calendars. His mind just simply doesn&amp;rsquo;t work that way. Quiz him on the date of my birthday and, given some time to think, he will probably get it. Ask him how far away that is and he will have no clue (He would need time to figure out which month we were in first).</description>

      <description>I LOVE Chick-Fil-A. I could go on and on about how family friendly they are, how good their food is, how I think Truitt Cathy is such a great example of a godly businessman&amp;hellip; but I will save my love affair with Chick-Fil-A, the inventors of the chicken sandwich, for another post, or two&amp;hellip;
Friday was Cow Appreciation Day. I know this because I subscribe to the Chick-Fil-A e-mail updates and I am in on all things up and coming at Chick-Fil-A.</description>

      <description>This past week our church hosted Vacation Bible School. I love that we do vacation Bible School because it provides a tangible way for our church to reach out and serve our surrounding community. Parents eager for a mid summer break are offered something fun for their kids to get involved in. Kids come to play games, make crafts, meet friends, eat snacks, sing songs and the leave having had a great time.</description>

      <description>Since my son turned 4 I no longer require him to nap every day. But to keep my sanity ensure that he has some down time, I do require him to have a quiet, rest time in his room while his sisters are napping. Most of the time he ends up falling asleep. Other times, he reads or plays with toys on his bed. On Monday afternoon he found a red pen in his room during this time and decided to transform himself into Spider Man.</description>

      <description>Time for another Sincerley Fro&#39; Me To You Post. Since my baby turns one this month, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share a pregnancy anecdote with you.
In January of last year my good friend told me she was pregnant with her third child. Her oldest son is 10 months younger than my son, and the two of them are good buddies. Her second son is 4 months younger than my middle child.</description>

1) What was I doing 10 years ago?
It was the summer after my freshman year of college. My parents moved to PA so I was spending the summer with them and preparing to transfer from Towson University to Slippery Rock Univeristy.</description>

      <description>I have a problem. Despite my best intentions, I seem incapable of returning library books on time. Upon returning home from the library, my husband often asks, &amp;ldquo;So, how much are these going to cost us?&amp;rdquo; It seems our library visits are taking a dramatic turn for the worst.
Even after our bad experience at the library , I took the kids back for books. This last time we weren&amp;rsquo;t scolded for our &amp;ldquo;inside voices&amp;rdquo; so I thought all was good.</description>

      <description>This spring I planted a garden with my kids. I use the term garden very loosely. We did plant seeds and some plants grew, but if you looked at my garden right now you can&amp;rsquo;t really tell the weeds from the plants. In fact my son calls the actual plants, &amp;ldquo;good weeds.&amp;rdquo; We planted the seeds in April. The kids and I were so excited. We weeded the garden, dug the row and planted the seeds.</description>

      <description>Over the years the fourth of July has become one of my favorite family fun holidays. We took the kids and both sets of grandparents to a local parade. The streets lined with children and American flags reminded me of something out of a movie. It felt like home town America. My favorite part is always when the Veteran&amp;rsquo;s march past. As I stand and clap and cheer, I can&amp;rsquo;t hold in the tears of gratitude for these men and woman who deserve honor and recognition.</description>

Here is a picture of my hubby and I in the spring of 1997 at an All Night Bowling event for my youth group. Please take note of the shirt I am wearing.
Two and a half years later here we are in October of 1999 at a College Football game.</description>

      <description>I think everyone should be so lucky as to be married to an engineer. While it is true that purchasing large or technical products such as televisions, cameras, or computers will take longer as we&amp;rsquo;ll he&amp;rsquo;ll have to research the various brands, settings, options and figure out which one is the best price and has the best features for us, when any of those things breaks he is not afraid to open them up and fix them (and since he spend a larger portion of his childhood taking a part such items he actually knows what he is looking at and how to fix it).</description>

      <description>Recently my 2 year old daughter has decided that a good way to pass time in the car is to scream really loudly. It&amp;rsquo;s also a really good way to annoy her older brother.
Typically we start driving down the road and she starts making some annoyingly loud noise and then 2 second after she starts, my son starts screaming, &amp;ldquo;Yell A Little Bit Quieter&amp;rdquo; followed by, &amp;ldquo;Mom, she&amp;rsquo;s not yelling a little bit quieter,&amp;rdquo; over and over.</description>

My four year old son told me yesterday that my legs &amp;ldquo;are prickly like a cactus.&amp;rdquo;
You better believe I made sure to get up early enough to shave my legs before leaving for church this morning. They are silky smooth now (a fact that my son and my husband are both glad about).</description>

      <description>This week I wrote about my daughter&amp;rsquo;s hang up call to the local police station. We have no idea how long we were &amp;quot;on the air&amp;quot; before she hung up. I immediately started thinking, &amp;quot;What did they hear during that time?&amp;quot; Thankfully It wasn&amp;rsquo;t one of those meltdown moments when everyone was whining and crying, but what exactly did we say?
I remember the day we discovered that our baby monitor could pick up the signal of our neighbor&amp;rsquo;s baby monitor.</description>

      <description>I was shopping at BJ&amp;rsquo;s the other day with the kids when we passed the jewelry counter.
My son asked, &amp;quot;Why is there jewelry at BJ&amp;rsquo;s?&amp;quot;
I responded, &amp;quot;So people can buy it.&amp;quot;
He then said, &amp;quot;Yea&amp;hellip; I guess if they were getting married and didn&amp;rsquo;t have a ring they could come here.&amp;quot;
Hmmm&amp;hellip;. clearly this Mommy doesn&amp;rsquo;t wear much jewelry, since my son thinks wedding rings are the only kind of jewelry one wears.</description>

      <description>Its Thursday again and time for me to go into that box in the closet under the stairs and find another picture that didn&amp;rsquo;t make it into a photo album. I found a classic that is truly timely. This is a picture of me opening gifts on my 13th birthday (I think, might be 12). Can&amp;rsquo;t tell what I am unwrapping, but my brother behind me is definitely interested. Like my dangling shell earrings?</description>

      <description>When my oldest daughter was born my son wanted to get her this musical turtle he saw at Target for her crib. Every time we went to Target he would push the buttons to make it play music and he would ask if he could get it for his sister. We didn&amp;rsquo;t think it was necessary.
He was still insistent about it when our third child was born so we decided to let him get it for his sister for Christmas.</description>

      <description>Kids like buttons. At least ours do. Our son was the first addict. We could keep him happy quiet for long periods of time by giving him the TV remote (with the TV off) and letting him just pound away. Him being the first, we were always careful when he got the phone. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want him to call someone unintentionally and have someone listening to uncensored Life at the Circus. He never really called anyone though, because life with one isn&amp;rsquo;t quite a circus, he just hit buttons.</description>

I posted a picture of my fridge and said it was &amp;ldquo;the end of the world as we know it.&amp;quot; But the truth is, I know nothing about going hungry. When I look at my fridge and complain about making dinner, there are millions of mothers who would look at the contents and shout with joy.

      <description>My son really took an interest in golfing this weekend while watching my husband follow the U.S. Open. My husband rarely golfs but does have a set of clubs and after very persistent requests, my husband let my son use his clubs in the back yard. He taught him the different types of clubs (drivers, putters, irons) and when they are used. My son had a blast hitting the ball with the putter (which was almost as long as him) in the back yard and then running over to putt it into the pretend hole (between my husband&amp;rsquo;s legs).</description>

      <description>Our pastor has been talking a lot lately about being transparent. As a Christian I too often present the world with a false squeaky clean image that gives the appearance that I think am perfect. Of course, everyone knows that no one is perfect so, when they see me ACTING perfect they know it is a false charade. What kind of credibility does that bring? No, I am far from perfect.</description>

      <description>I mentioned here, that I started running this summer. I am following a training schedule to help me reach my goal but it keeps changing the distance that I must run each day. Instead of guestimating (surely it&amp;rsquo;s been a mile by now) or driving the route with the car (like I really feel like loading the kids another time) to try to calculate the distance, my wonderful husband, the engineer, found me an online application made using google maps that is a HUGE help!</description>

      <description>It’s my 100 th post, so I thought I’d post a hundred things about myself…
 I love the smell of play dough. I like to have a night light on in our room at night. When I am baking cookies I tend to eat at least half of the dough. I hate vanilla ice cream. I also don’t like cake, especially chocolate cake. So, you don’t think I am crazy, I do have a weakness for ice cream, especially hand scooped, particularly chocolate peanut butter.</description>

      <description>The other morning I came around the corner to find my 4 year old son unscrewing the screw from the switch plate of our light. He had gotten his chair, pulled it up to the light switch, found the right size Phillips screw driver, and had gotten the screw mostly off. I noticed he had been quiet for awhile when I peeked around the corner to check on him and saw this.</description>

      <description>I love my children immensely and would do anything for them. When my children disobey, I do not love them any less. My love for them is not based on whether or not they behave in the store or if they place nicely with each other. I have loved my children since before they were born and the moment I held them for the first time that love multiplied and has grown daily.</description>

      <description>Last week I registered for a 10 mile run at the end of August. For over a year now I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to do this. I ran a 5K for the first time when my son was a year old. I ran two more when my 2 year old was 6 mths old. Until last Tuesday, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t run since.
I waited through one of the mildest winter and spring seasons I&amp;rsquo;ve seen here and decided to start running during the week of record breaking heat.</description>

      <description>For as long as I can remember my Dad and I have bonded over sports. While most kids were getting quizzed on states and capitals, we&amp;rsquo;d play a game where he&amp;rsquo;d say a city and I&amp;rsquo;d have to name the baseball and or football team from that city. I loved this game! As evidenced here, he raised me as a Steelers fan since I was an infant. When I moved to MD he would tape the games not televised here and mail them to me so my husband and I could watch them mid week.</description>

&amp;quot;Ew, gross!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I don&amp;rsquo;t like it!&amp;quot; How many of you have had this response after working hard to prepare a new dish for you family? It can be quite frustrating especially if you know they&amp;rsquo;ll like it b/c they like every single one of the ingredients in it or worse yet, they devoured it the last time you made it and now won&amp;rsquo;t even try it.
My husband and I have always insisted the our kids at least try a bite of whatever it is we&amp;rsquo;re eating.</description>

      <description>When asked what it was like to get the power back on Friday, I replied &amp;quot; A lot of work.&amp;quot;
After throwing away the spoiled food inside of my fridge and freezer, this is what I faced.

After an hour of scrubbing&amp;hellip;

Here are a few tips I learned from the cleaning process.
 If your power goes out and everything in your fridge spoils, clean out the freezer BEFORE the power comes back on and all the melted stuff in your freezer refreezes.</description>

My son was playing on the deck when I suddenly heard him say, &amp;ldquo;Help Mom, I&amp;rsquo;m stuck.&amp;rdquo; I turned around to see this.

As I got him out of the basketball net, I asked him what on earth he was doing?</description>

Psalm 100:4
&amp;ldquo;Enter His gates with thanksgiving and His courts with praise; give thanks to Him and praise His name.&amp;quot;
I often take things for granted and then when something happens and they don&amp;rsquo;t go as usual, I feel a sense of entitlement and am quite put out. I was listening to the Christian radio station today and someone was talking about a ministry (Blood Water Mission) they work for which helps provide clean water to people in Third World countries.</description>

      <description>It was a big day for me. I know your thinking, yes, we know already, you got your power back. And yes I did, but that is not what I am referring to. I pulled into the parking lot of Target (which is 20 min away) with all 3 kids, at 8:30 AM. If you have kids, you recognize the monumental occasion this is.
Wanna know the secret to my record breaking time?</description>

      <description>As my husband mentioned here, we lost power this week. The first thing I did when the power came back on?
Brush my teeth?
No
Shower?
No
Go to the bathroom?
No
I posted this on the internet so &amp;ldquo;the world&amp;rdquo; could know we are back. Aren&amp;rsquo;t you glad to know I&amp;rsquo;ve got my priorities right?
It&amp;rsquo;s been a fun few days around here. Really, it could have been so much worse.</description>

      <description>We lost power at about 4pm on Wednesday. Losing power really wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be so bad if it didn’t mean that I had to loose water too. It makes you realize how often you run to the sink to clean up messes the kids leave in their wake. the kids have been handling it really well. I told my son that the electricity was out and about a hour later the following discussion took place.</description>

      <description>I thought I’d post a picture from my honeymoon since 7 years ago today I was in St Lucia with my hubby. Being married to Scott has been a grand adventure. He’s taken me lower and higher than I thought I’d ever go. Whether it’s exploring the world below sea level, or hiking along a glacier, he’s pushed me to do things I’d never have thought of doing on my own.</description>

      <description>Traveling for 5 hours in a minivan with 3 young children and one dog sounds like a kicking good time, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it? Since my parents live a little over 5 hrs from us, we&amp;rsquo;ve gotten quite adjusted to the trip. And surprisingly, it isn&amp;rsquo;t that bad. We&amp;rsquo;ve had our bad trips (like the time my son got the stomach flu the morning we were heading back home and puked every 30 min the entire way home), but overall we&amp;rsquo;ve found the key to happiness is letting the kids entertain themselves.</description>

      <description>Are you familiar with facebook? I sure have gotten a chuckle out of it. I went to a girls night out last month and listened to my friends ask, &amp;ldquo;Are you my friend?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;How can I get more friends?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Why aren&amp;rsquo;t you my friend?&amp;rdquo; I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but laugh as it sounded so much like middle school.
But, I finally broke down yesterday and got a Facebook account. I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten those e-mails saying, &amp;ldquo;Your friend Jane has a facebook account, sign up too.</description>

      <description>My husband and I were talking in the kitchen when my son popped in and dropped a bomb on us. We appreciate his upfront honesty but we were caught totally off guard.
We&amp;rsquo;re trying hard to take deal with this rationally, but what parents wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be devastated.
It&amp;rsquo;s just that he showed so much promise. His is so smart. We try not to get carried away with his potential but we couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but to dream about where his future could go.</description>

I am entering this photo in the Nestle &amp;ldquo;The Kid in You&amp;rdquo; Photo Contest over at 5 Minutes for Mom for the chance to win a Nintendo Wii. (I played a Wii for the first time this weekend at the house of Muthering Heights and let&amp;rsquo;s just say the prize is appropriate because playing tennis really brought out the kid in all of us) !</description>

As we sat under the stars Friday night, I was in awe of our awesome creator God. Sitting around the fire, I could see the big dipper and I saw 2 shooting stars. The stars were so bright. Thank you Father for the beautiful picture of your handiwork.

That&amp;rsquo;s what my days felt like this week&amp;hellip; the good news is that my older two have been playing very well together, so well that I haven&amp;rsquo;t felt the need to go to playgroup or find a play date to get us all out of the house. They&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed playing their various pretend games in one section of the house, while I was able to work on something productive in a different part.</description>

Daughter: &amp;ldquo;No kiss, Only Daddy Kiss.&amp;rdquo;
Mommy: &amp;ldquo;But he&amp;rsquo;s your brother and he was being nice.&amp;rdquo;
Daughter: &amp;ldquo;No, only Daddy kiss.&amp;rdquo;
Mommy: &amp;ldquo;So, the only boy that can kiss you is Daddy?&amp;rdquo;
Daughter: &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo;
Daddy was a happy man when I shared this anecdote.</description>

We feed the kids a simple dinner&amp;hellip; chicken nuggets or hot dogs. While I am getting the kids ready for bed, my husband grills us steak for dinner. We light a candle and enjoy a leisurely dinner together. We get to talk, uninterrupted and enjoy our food while it is still warm.</description>

      <description>Last night we were walking along the beach in our neighborhood and someone walked by with her two dogs. One big dog passed to our right, the other between my son and I to our left. As this was happening she asked if the kids were ok with dogs. It was then that I realized how I&amp;rsquo;ve taken this fact for granted.
I am not a dog person. When I go to other dog owners homes, you won&amp;rsquo;t see me sitting on the floor playing with the dog or cuddling them on my lap.</description>

      <description>Driving home the other day my 2 year old, called from the back of the van, &amp;ldquo;Excuse me mom, where&amp;rsquo;s baby?&amp;rdquo; I would have panicked had I not just heard her babbling moments before. Since, it was obvious she was there, I answered with something silly like, &amp;ldquo;Driving the car.&amp;rdquo; She erupted in giggles and thus began our newest comedy routine.
This was our conversation all the way to church this morning, in the parking lot after church while we were waiting for Daddy to finish talking, on the way out to lunch, on the way home&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>This weekend we are celebrating my husband&amp;rsquo;s 29th birthday. As I look back at some of his baby pictures, (isn&amp;rsquo;t he such a cutie) I am so thankful for the man he is today and feel incredibly blessed to call him my husband.
There are many things I respect about him, but at the top of the list would be his integrity, his perseverance, and his wisdom. We&amp;rsquo;ve been married almost 7 years now and since I get to live with him day in and day out, I truly get to see all sides of him and I can honestly say that he is consistent and that he genuinely strives each day to glorify God in all he does.</description>

      <description>Last September we sadly and suddenly had to put our puppy Claire to sleep. She was only 2.5 yrs old, but she got really sick and after numerous tests and watching her health dramatically decline in a matter of a week, we were left with no other options.

My husband was heartbroken. He is an animal lover through and through. The kids took the news pretty well. The girls really didn&amp;rsquo;t notice because we had two dogs and so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t like suddenly they were left without a dog to play with.</description>

      <description>4 years ago today my sister in law got married. My son was exactly one month old. I went dress shopping so I could find something to hide the 50 pounds of baby fat I gained. Hard to find a dress flattering enough to do that, but somehow I managed to find one that I was happy with. [] (https://latc.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/the-dress-2.jpg)
Until I got to the church.
I was a new mom and new at the whole nursing thing.</description>

      <description>The other day I discovered a way to occupy my kids for a good 15-20 min, which many of you know is an eternity in Mommy time.
Wanna know the secret?
I let them play with my clock radio. I plugged it in and placed it on the floor in the living room. They had a blast taking turns turning it off and on and changing radio stations. It was more fun then Mommy turning on the stereo, because they had control of turning it on and off as well the fun of switching the music from station to station.</description>

      <description>Last week my two year old wanted desperatly to hold my 9 month old. This is a practice I don&amp;rsquo;t generally encourage, unless I am trying to take a picture of the kids together, then it&amp;rsquo;s used as a bribe. Let Mommy take your picture and you can hold your sister! This time however, it went the other way around&amp;hellip;Mommy you can take a picture if you let me hold my sister.</description>

      <description>Since Christmas my 4 year old son has built up quite a weapons arsenal.

A few days before Christmas my sister in law called to ask if it was OK for our son to have a toy gun for Christmas. Since we had just been to the store looking for one, I think our answer was pretty obvious.

In January my husband built wooden swords for him and my son to practice sword fighting.</description>

      <description>Last night the power went out for 3 hours. My 2 year old woke up in pitch darkness and obviously was scared. I fumbled my way to her room using the glow from our glow in the dark stars to guide my way. I then slept on her floor to help her fall back asleep. Occasionally she&amp;rsquo;d wake up scared and I would reach my hand up to let her know I was still there.</description>

      <description>The other day our two year old had a really bad diaper rash. Her poor bottom was BRIGHT RED and she screamed out in pain when we had to change her diaper. My son looked at her bottom and exclaimed, &amp;ldquo;Diaper rash is my favorite color!&amp;rdquo;
That boy makes me laugh.</description>

      <description>Looking at this picture one would assume I was preparing to dive into the swimming pool. Don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled. Despite being on the swim team for 5 summers and having literally every adult I knew work with me one on one, I never learned to dive. This is me looking the part before I belly flopped into the swimming pool.
Starting in about 3rd grade and going through the end of middle school, I spent every summer on the swim team.</description>

      <description>Last weekend my husband picked my daughter up and noticed she was incredibly wet. He commented that someone must have put her diaper on wrong (Since I was the grownup home at last diaper change, the blame obviously fell to me). I muttered something about those stupid diapers not absorbing properly.

Check out her look of disappointment. (MOM, you let me down)!

My husband called me in to check out what went wrong with the diaper&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Yesterday I posted about how similar our life is to the real circus we visited last week. I would now like to point out two unfortunate differences.
At the circus they have these men dressed in all black that come into the ring between acts and clean up. They remove equipment, clean up poop, and set up for the next act. I need these men at my house. Imagine if after the meal (act 1) these men just instantly appeared and quietly, miraculously, cleaned up the mess when we move on to playtime (act 2).</description>

      <description>Last week we took our kids to the circus. We couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but notice the many similarities between life at our house and life under the big top.
At the circus, they had people who could stand on their hands. We&amp;rsquo;ve got that.

There were wild animals which had been tamed. Yup, we&amp;rsquo;ve got that too.

There were also people hanging upside down from their legs. We&amp;rsquo;ve got that too.</description>

      <description>Two months ago, my mom came across some of my old school papers and she passed this one along to me. I wrote it in first grade. I have no recollection of writing this, but I have to think that God smiled as I wrote it, thinking, &amp;ldquo;You have no idea Crystal that your dream will come true exactly as you wish for.&amp;rdquo; Today I thank God for allowing me to be the mom to 3 wonderful children, one son and two daughters.</description>

      <description>Since Mother&amp;rsquo;s Day is this weekend, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d make my thoughtful post about my mother. Growing up my mom was my best friend. She was approachable and always willing to listen. I could ask her about anything and she never made me feel awkward or silly. Mom knew how to make things special. She decorated the house for the seasons and holidays and made our birthdays into something we looked forward to all year.</description>

      <description>My kids and I have truly enjoyed our local library. We go to to story time, baby story time, special events, and we go just to check out books. The kids LOVE it! It&amp;rsquo;s a happy place, a fun place, a place where a kid can be a kid&amp;hellip; until today.
I took the kids to the library earlier this week to pick out books. I know my kids can be loud.</description>

      <description>Week End Thoughts&amp;hellip;
I decided to move my Thoughtful Thursday since I am participating in We Are THAT Family&amp;rsquo;s Sincerely Fro&#39; Me to You carnival on Thursdays. Since &amp;ldquo;Thoughtful Thursday&amp;rdquo; is something I made up, it seems trivial to move the day&amp;hellip; same theme, only we&amp;rsquo;ll call it Week End Thoughts&amp;hellip;
Week End Thoughts:
My posts typically relate funny anecdotes about the happenings of a stay at home wife and mom with three kids.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned last Thursday, I attended a small Christian High School with only 44 students in my graduating class. The school was small enough that you could play a Varsity sport without actually being good at the sport (granted I sat the bench, but still I earned a letter warming that bench) and the majority of the school was in the marching band. Seriously, you were cool if you were in the marching band.</description>

      <description>Last fall my husband and I took our three kids on a plane ride to CA to visit my husband&amp;rsquo;s grandparents and to take in some National Parks. The trip itself is worthy of a post, someday, but for now I&amp;rsquo;ll just share about our flight out there&amp;hellip;.
It seems obvious that when flying with three kids under 3 you bring a lot of stuff. We knew we would have to change flights half way so we tried to keep things to a minimum.</description>

      <description>My son is very smart (every mother says this about her children so I might as well enjoy my entitlement). He is only 4 but he has always had a knack for asking good questions and is satisfied by only believable answers. We pride ourselves on honesty so that &amp;ldquo;believable answer&amp;rdquo; always contains the truth but not necessarily more truth then is absolutely required. Case in point: For a year we got away with calling a certain, frequent and noticeable neighborhood visitor, &amp;ldquo;the music truck&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share my 4 year olds favorite lunch sandwich with you all this week. Those of you feeling a bit adventurous might want to give it a try. You put peanut butter on one slice of bread, grape jelly on the other (nothing new here) and in the middle you place a slice of cheese and a few slices of ham. He invented it, he LOVES it and has eaten it every day for lunch for the past few weeks.</description>

      <description>If any of you are like me you love buying cards. Actually, if your anything like me you have three kids and you used to love buying cards. I remember the good old days when a friend and I would go to Hallmark and spend too much time reading, laughing, picking out cards. It was relaxing. I enjoyed finding those perfect cards to give to people. I enjoyed it so much that I would eagerly try to come up with people whose birthdays or special days were approaching somewhere in the next month.</description>

      <description>Mothers Day is coming soon and it has got me thinking about the many things I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about motherhood before I became a mom. There really is no way to mentally prepare. I remember the day after my first child was born sitting in the hospital filling out paperwork. When I saw the line for Mother I honestly thought, &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s odd, I wonder why they need to know my mom&amp;rsquo;s name.</description>

My husband and I are high school sweethearts. We went to a small Christian school with only 44 students in our graduating class. Because our last names were on opposite ends of the alphabet we never had home room together.</description>

      <description>Keeping three kids happy while waiting at the doctors office is a difficult task. Usually we get through the waiting room without a problem&amp;hellip; the kids can rearrange the chairs, roll around on the floor, take magazines off of the shelf and occasionally sit quietly in my lap and read a book. It&amp;rsquo;s that tiny examination room that presents the problem. I know they keep the place clean but the bottom line is that doctors offices are where sick people go and I would rather we keep our germs to ourselves.</description>

      <description>My oldest and youngest had well visits today. Our trip to the pediatrician&amp;rsquo;s office was a circus act in and of itself. I made the appointment for 8:30a.m. The nice thing about early appointments is that we don&amp;rsquo;t have to wait long in the waiting room. The hard part is that it takes an insane amount of work to get the three kids fed, dressed (they can&amp;rsquo;t exactly show up in dirty underwear and pjs) and in the minivan by 8:10&amp;hellip;not to mention the fact that I usually try to look presentable myself which means I have to actually shower and do something with my hair.</description>

Yes, you read that correctly and if bathroom talk/humor is not your thing, then I suggest you skip this post.
The following incident actually occurred in my house today.

When my 2 year old sees hot dogs in the fridge she says, &amp;ldquo;hot dogs daddy make&amp;rdquo; (Truth is Daddy makes anything that is on the grill, but hot dogs is the meat of choice for the kids) Anyway, here&amp;rsquo;s to more than just hot dogs!</description>

      <description>I started a policy at our house a few months ago which said, &amp;ldquo;Dessert only on Weekends.&amp;rdquo; My son is a great policeman on this and will ask throughout the week, &amp;ldquo;Is it the weekend yet?&amp;rdquo; If I serve dessert during the week, he often calls me out on it, but always happily partakes. I must confess the last few weeks I have really gone lax on this policy&amp;hellip; it was his birthday, or we had company over, or ummm we had leftovers&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>Mothering takes a lot of hard work and a lot of late nights. While I only have four years of experience to look back on, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure it is moments like these that I will cherish when I&amp;rsquo;m old and gray.

5 Minutes for Mom is hosting a Mother&amp;rsquo;s Day Photo Contest asking bloggers to post a picture that defines motherhood; I knew right away that I had to recycle this previous Wordless Wednesday.</description>

      <description>I fear I have become a gadget person. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how or when it happened, but recently I have noticed the signs. Two weeks ago when on my date night with hubby, we had some extra time after our Toys R Us date, so I asked if we could run in the mall to look at the new iphone at the apple store. Yes, you read that correctly. I asked my husband if we could go look at technological equipment that I knew we couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford and weren&amp;rsquo;t going to buy, just b/c I wanted to play with one.</description>

      <description>Last week as we were running errands the Christian radio station played one of those 60 sec minisermons. The person was speaking on 1 John 4 and read the passage which states, &amp;ldquo;This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.&amp;rdquo;
Son: &amp;quot; Mom, why did she say we don&amp;rsquo;t love God?&amp;quot;
Me: &amp;ldquo;They were saying that we didn&amp;rsquo;t love God first, but that God loved us and then we loved him.</description>

      <description>I have been singing the praises of oxiclean for some time now. It has gotten poop, tomato sauce, mud, and spit up out of my clothes for years. This Easter I REALLY put it to the test. We were dying eggs with the kids. My two year old had just plopped her egg into the red dye when she tipped the mug to peer into it and check out her handiwork.</description>

      <description>Tonight I was out all evening. I met a friend for dinner and then went to a steering meeting for my MOPS group. My wonderful husband stayed home with the kids. He made them waffles for dinner and they had a super hero night. My son received a Super Hero Starter Kit for his birthday which included an instruction book, real cape, eye masks and shield stickers. My son has been wearing his cape for days and my hubby has been teaching him how to be a super hero.</description>

      <description>They warned me this would happen. I told myself I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do it. And yet, I did and they were right. Darn those &amp;ldquo;experienced moms&amp;rdquo; who&amp;rsquo;ve been there and done that. Just last night I brought him home from the hospital and got up at least 8 times during the night to make sure he was still in the bassinet at the foot of our bed. During one of those middle of the night feedings I did the forbidden&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>Nope, it&amp;rsquo;s not my birthday&amp;hellip; too late for Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day&amp;hellip;.. too early for Mother&amp;rsquo;s Day. This was just an &amp;ldquo;I love you&amp;rdquo; gift. It was made of clear fishing line with little foam charms. My son was very proud to tell me that he had made it himself with a plastic needle.
When my son gave me this bracelet which he made, &amp;ldquo;because I love you Mom&amp;rdquo; my heart melted. I wore it all day.</description>

      <description>I weeded our flower beds this week with my 4y, 2y and 9m old. This is not an equation for efficiency, but we had fun&amp;hellip;.
We found an earthworm and I was really proud of myself for not going &amp;ldquo;eek&amp;rdquo; when I uncovered it in the dirt. Not only did I not shriek, but I feigned excitement and got my kids to be excited about it. My 2 year old tried to eat it (you have to watch her)!</description>

      <description>Yesterday when we were out running errands my son told me,
&amp;ldquo;Mom, I am going to be really good at nap time today.&amp;rdquo;
I was in the midst of trying to find the things on my mental list and push the cart with three kids on it, so I muttered something like, &amp;ldquo;good honey&amp;rdquo; and continued on. My son was so excited because after nap time we were going to plant flowers in our yard.</description>

      <description>If you read my blog post from Sunday you know that getting my laundry washed, dryed, folded, and put away is a big challenge for me. Today I found a way to help speed along that process. Even though my kids have an entire toy room which they can play in, they begged me to let them play in the pack-n-play while I folded laundry. Yes, that is correct, I actually said to my two and four year old, &amp;ldquo;If you fight or hit each other in there, you will have to come OUT of the pack-n-play.</description>

      <description>Last night I got a chocolate craving. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like doing a ton of work to feed this craving so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d bake some No Bake Cookies. Growing up this was often the cure for a chocolate craving with minimal effort. When I opened my cabinet to get out the sugar I noticed a sticky brown residue on the container.
&amp;quot;Uh-oh&amp;quot; I thought.
Upon further investigation I found molasses covering the entire shelf, the box of aluminum foil, the pancake box, the corn muffin box and still no molasses jar.</description>

      <description>bane
(bn) n. **** A source of persistent annoyance or exasperation
When talking about laundry to my husband, I typically describe it as the &amp;ldquo;bane of my existence.&amp;rdquo; No matter how hard I try to get it washed, folded, and put away, I typically fall short of accomplishing all 3 of those steps. Most often I get it washed, dried, and dumped on to our guest bed (which my husband now affectionately calls his dresser).</description>

      <description>With spring like weather finally here, we&amp;rsquo;ve been spending some more time outside. I took these series of pictures of the kids out on our deck. Note the sequence of events.
Baby is playing cutely in boat so Mommy decides to take a picture.
 Big Sister notices and has to get in on the action and spotlight.
&amp;ldquo;Hey, don&amp;rsquo;t leave me out!&amp;rdquo;
Poor baby is off to find something else to play with.</description>

      <description>Tonight I had a hot date with my hubby. My son&amp;rsquo;s birthday is coming up and we needed to go shopping for his present. Since we had to get a babysitter to watch the kids, we decided to take full advantage of that fact and we went out for dinner as well. I really enjoyed having an uninterrupted conversation with him while getting to hold his hand as we walked into the store.</description>

Curious?

      <description>My son loves sunsets. He comes by it naturally as his father also enjoys looking at God&amp;rsquo;s handiwork. One evening, several months ago, when we were looking out the window for Daddy to come home, he pointed out to me how pretty the sunset was. I told him that sunsets are like pictures that God draws for us to show us He loves us. I told him that just like he draws pictures for me and Daddy to show us he loves us, God makes the sunsets to show us that HE loves US (pretty amazing stuff)!</description>

&amp;ldquo;Peanuts?&amp;rdquo; I asked.
&amp;ldquo;No&amp;rdquo;
Then I realized, &amp;ldquo;Oh Peppermint Patty?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Yup!&amp;rdquo;
I think I may start calling them that from now on :-)</description>

      <description>Today I took the kids to the grocery store and in addition to some much needed food, the older two each got a balloon with a lollipop tied to the bottom. The store has them for free at the check out. A nice bonus for everyone! After I unloaded the van, they were out on the back deck eating their lollipops while I putting away the groceries. I heard some commotion, so I went outside and saw my daughter staring up at the sky like this.</description>

      <description>I am a big fan of Oreo cookies. They are the only store bought cookie I buy and when I see them on sale I have a really hard time not putting at least one bag in my grocery cart! I have noticed that there are many ways to eat an Oreo. I never taught my kids how to eat them, yet each has his and her own preference. My daughter likes to open them up, lick out the cream, and then discard the rest of the cookie.</description>

      <description>I have found that I save a ton of grocery money as well trips to the grocery store, by making a monthly meal plan. I write on my calendar my meals for the month. Then, I make my grocery lists based on that and theoretically, I have all I need for us to eat for the month (with the exception of produce and milk, which I have to return to the store multiple times for).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m only one week into my blogging adventure and I already had to skip a day. Yesterday was one of THOSE days. Those of you with kids, know what I mean. It started Friday night when all 3 of my kids woke at various points throughout the night coughing, moaning and generally not feeling well (thankfully, no puking occurred). The &amp;ldquo;night&amp;rdquo; ended for good at 6:20 when I was up giving my son water, then my daughter a nebulizer treatment for her asthma and as soon as I finished, I heard the baby crying for me to nurse her!</description>

I gotta slow down, I am eating too fast!&amp;rdquo; I asked him where he heard that and he said, &amp;ldquo;Daddy, when he saw a 2 and a 0 on the scale he said, &amp;ldquo;Woah, I gotta slow down and stop eating so many cookies.&amp;rdquo; (Please note, I got permission from Daddy to post this anecdote.)</description>

When I went to the kitchen I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find it. Every now and then when I thought about it, I would look around trying to figure out what it was.
The other night I was talking on the phone and doing some dishes when I looked at our window and saw a U.</description>

      <description>Our middle child really likes to put things in order. Before she goes to bed at night she puts each of her stuffed animals in a straight row beside her pillow. I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed recently that she seems to gravitate towards put things things into straight lines. When she plays with blocks she puts them next to each other in a row, like a road, rather then stacking them one on top of the other.</description>

      <description>My son&amp;rsquo;s birthday is approaching and I asked him earlier this week who he wanted to invite to his party. After hearing the list of the usual people he said, &amp;ldquo;There is this girl in my Sunday School class that is my friend. She laughs at my jokes and thinks it&amp;rsquo;s funny when I put a banana on my head. Can I invite her?&amp;rdquo; After further talk I figured out who he meant and added her to the invite list.</description>

      <description>I love my son&amp;rsquo;s imagination. He can turn a cooking pot into a race car or become a dog by merely wearing his shoes on his hands. Here are a few pictures of his antics from this morning. They made me smile and I hope they do the same for you!
He called out to me in the other room, &amp;ldquo;Hey Mom, look I am siting on the pot!&amp;rdquo; When I heard these words, they brought a different image to mind.</description>

      <description>This morning when my kids were eating breakfast my son asked,
&amp;ldquo;Mom, what happened to your flower?&amp;rdquo; I looked on the deck and it was gone. I asked my hubby if he moved it and he said,&amp;quot; No, but last night when I was sitting out at the dining room table, I did hear a  crash outside when the wind blew.&amp;quot;
My kids went out to investigate this morning and it seems my poor flower decided to take her life with a fateful jump off of our deck, rather than to continue to suffer under my care.</description>

      <description>If my geographic area is hit with a EMP, nuclear bomb, or a Katrina like natural disaster, I hope that it does not come at the end of the month. If we are left to fend for ourselves at the end of the month than my family&amp;rsquo;s future would be bleak, as you can see by this photo taken this morning of my refrigerator. How long can a sack of potatoes, 2 dozen eggs, a jar of spaghetti sauce and some American cheese really last you?</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t have a green thumb. I want to, but truth be told, I lack the follow through. On Wednesday my husband and I went to a dinner for his work and they had potted flowers on all of the tables. Afterwards we each got to take one home. As we drove home with it in the car, my husband said to me, &amp;ldquo;So, how long before you kill it?&amp;rdquo; I replied with a &amp;ldquo;ugh&amp;rdquo; and a look that said how dare you say that&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>I finished a book this weekend. It is called Tending Roses by Lisa Wingate. The book really touched me on many levels. I think I could relate to the main character somewhat b/c I too am a mom with small children. The main character spends 3 weeks living with her grandma after her grandma has suffered a stroke. Her grandma records some life lessons in a notebook which she leaves out on the table for her to find.</description>

      <description>My kids love kidney beans. When I was introducing solids to my first born I was very cautious. I was so afraid he would choke on things that I took it painfully slow. And he really wasn&amp;rsquo;t interested in meat for awhile. (the joys of chicken nuggets and hot dogs as staples in our diet, didn&amp;rsquo;t come until his was older) My pediatrician suggested I give him kidney beans. She said they were a great source of protein and they were soft and chewy so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to freak out about him choking.</description>

      <description>My son woke me up this morning at 6:15. Usually when this happens it is so that he can tell me he has to go potty. Today we had the following exchange, &amp;ldquo;Mommy.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Yes,&amp;rdquo; I replied very sleepily. &amp;ldquo;I am wearing red.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Yes, you are, go back to bed.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;OK.&amp;rdquo; He went back to bed until 7. Not sure why he felt the need to tell me that at 6:15 this morning, but I did get a chuckle out of it as I rolled over and went back to sleep.</description>

      <description>I have been playing with the idea of doing a blog for some time. I think it is something I will really enjoy. I have really gotten into reading others blogs. I even have some blog friends who have no idea that I exist, but whose thoughts I read daily and think, &amp;ldquo;wow, these ladies are great. we would totally be friends!&amp;rdquo; Now it is my turn to enter the blog world and share my thoughts and musings with the world.</description>

      <description>Our good friend Bob posted this on his blog and I wanted to link to it in my Weekend Thought. Since his blog is for invited readers only, he gave me permission to post it on my blog and link to it that way. I was struck by the beauty of his poem.
Catechism 714

Of all things
she wanted to know
the colors of heaven
