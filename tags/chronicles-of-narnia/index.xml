      <description>The kids and I started reading the Chronicles of Narnia a few weeks ago. I finished reading them The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe and we’re now onto Prince Caspian . The truth is, I’ve never read these books before, so I am just as interested and captivated as my oldest son is. The other day during quiet time the oldest two kids started walking back and forth between their separate areas… eventually they asked if they could play quietly together and I let them as long as they stayed quiet.</description>
