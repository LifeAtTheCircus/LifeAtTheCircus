      <description>It’s funny how our New Years Eve festivities have changed through the years. Scott and I have never been big party animals, but we did go to downtown Pittsburgh on Dec 31, 1999 to ring in the new millennium with a kiss on the Roberto Clemente bridge. For several years we would watch the fireworks in Annapolis at midnight.
Then we had kids.
And New Years became a stay at home night.</description>
