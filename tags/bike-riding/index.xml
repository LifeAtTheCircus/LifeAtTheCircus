      <description>Spring weather arrived this weekend. We literally spent the entire day outside on Sunday (other than the time we were in Sunday School and church). It was wonderfully refreshing. A friend from church passed down a toddler bike with training wheels. My littlest guy was so excited to ride a big kid bike. 
I was impressed with how quickly he caught on to peddling. After two trips around the court, he could start himself, steer, and even ring his bell while peddling.</description>

      <description>Truthfully, the circus family doesn’t spend much time on bikes. We do a lot of fun things here, don’t get me wrong, but there are only so many hours in a day, and teaching our kids to ride bikes has not been where we’ve spent ours.
But, today the sun was shining, the weather was unseasonably warm here in MD again, and as the kids played in the backyard while Scott did yard work, our oldest daughter decided that today she wanted to ride her bike without training wheels.</description>
