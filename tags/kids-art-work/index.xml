      <description>The other day after quiet time my oldest emerged from his room with his first book. I knew nothing of his project until he emerged but was blown away by what he produced. On the cover page his listed himself as the “osr” and “iliusha” (author and illustrator). For his first book, he pretty much spells out the gospel message in word and pictures.
Page One: “God loved us” (I must say the spelling on this one def made me chuckle).</description>

      <description>My oldest two have gotten into the habit of “e-mailing” each other at the beginning of nap time. And by e-mailing they really mean they are drawing pictures and writing messages back and forth to each other. We’ve worked out a system in which they are allowed to e-mail for the first 30 minutes of nap time. Then, they have to have quiet time in separate rooms for the remaining hour and a half.</description>
