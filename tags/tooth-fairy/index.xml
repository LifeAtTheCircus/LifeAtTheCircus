      <description>She’s been wiggling that tooth for weeks now… hoping and hoping it was ready to pull. I could see the tip of the new one peeking through behind it so I figured it was time for it to come out.
Daddy always does the honors round here, so she sweetly begged Daddy to pull it this morning before leaving for work. 

Part way in Scott realized that maybe that tooth wasn’t as ready to come out as we thought.</description>

      <description>I love the ever changing smiles on my kiddos faces as they lose teeth and then gain new/big teeth. Over the past month or so my 7 year old lost 3 teeth… the latest one to come out was last night. 
She’s starting to look older to me lately…</description>

The tooth fairy is pulling over time here at the circus… luckily, someone has forgotten to put his teeth under his pillow, so he’s cashing in tonight with all 3 he lost in the last 2 weeks… I love his new Jack-o-Lantern grin…however, I am not so keen on how grown up he’s looking these days. Though that seems to be a ongoing refrain round these parts. </description>

      <description>Since my oldest lost his first tooth, last spring, the tooth fairy has made 4 more visits to the circus. And judging by the giant front tooth dangling from my oldest sons top row, I think she’ll be back again this week!
As you may recall, we pulled my son’s first tooth in a very unconventional manner. His second tooth was pulled the normal way by dad. For his third tooth, he was very eager to pull it himself when his grandparents were here, so they could see.</description>

      <title>Another Circus First</title>

      <description>The time had finally come for the tooth to be pulled. While our son was more than ready for it to come out, Dad was secretly uneasy about the venture. “He trusts me” Scott confided to me in the hallway, “What if I hurt him?” Then Scott got another one of his moments of sheer fatherhood brilliance.
“I’ll let him do it,” he declared.
He tied one end of the dental floss to his light saber and the other to his tooth.</description>
