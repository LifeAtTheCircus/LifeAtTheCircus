      <description>5 years ago this month, God took her home to heaven. Though the truth is, Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s/Dementia took Grandma from us long before then. At first she’d just forget what time we’d be leaving for church the next day or when we’d be eating dinner. Later she forgot her grandchildren, children, and eventually even her own identity. Bit by bit the disease took more of her. I remember walking into the care facility the weekend Scott and I had gotten engaged.</description>
