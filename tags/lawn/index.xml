      <description>All of my kids have enjoyed pushing the pretend mower along side their Daddy, but I do believe none of them have enjoyed it as much as our youngest. The look of absolute GLEE on his face when he hears Daddy say it’s time for him to go cut the grass is absolutely priceless. 
He even willingly will choose to stay behind with Dad to cut grass and meet the rest of us at the pool MISSING SOME SWIM TIME rather than miss the chance to cut the grass with his Dad.</description>

      <description>I glanced out my back window on Saturday and saw this

Only, I didn’t just see this precious moment in time, but simultaneously, my mind flashed back to several other similar moments over the past 5 years….
September 2009

August 2008

And, April 2007

One can’t help but notice a few things when observing these father/child bonding moments in the back yard.
1. Believe it or not Scott, we’ve been VERY successful in growing grass in our backyard these past 5 years!</description>
