      <description>The kids were outside playing and I took a few minutes to prep lunch and wash a few dishes.Â As I walked by the back door, I saw my youngest sitting in a box on the deck.

How cute I thought and went to grab the camera.
My little man spotted me.
I went back to my chores and then noticed he had moved.
This time he was on the other side of the door and had set up a barricade with another box.</description>
