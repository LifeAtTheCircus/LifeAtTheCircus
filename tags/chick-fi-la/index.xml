      <description>My children have been inundated with Chick-Fil-A from birth. The first thing I ate after my daughter’s delivery was a CFA sandwich. I have scrapbook pages in each of my daughter’s first year scrapbooks, dedicated to their first Kids Meals at Chick-Fil-A. The first logo/graphic my son recognized was for Chick-Fil-A. Anytime he saw a cursive C when he was a toddler, he thought it was the word Chick-Fil-A. They’ve known and loved the Chick-Fil-A cow since they were babies and we’ve even dressed like one for the past 5 years.</description>

      <description>My family’s love for Chick-Fil-A goes deep and wide. [

The first symbol my son recognized was for Chick-Fil-A. He could “read” it at age 2. And anytime he saw a cursive C he thought it stood for Chick-Fil-A. At that same age, I showed him a symbol for the golden arches and he had no idea what it was. My daughter’s one year scrapbooks both have pages dedicated to their “first Chick-Fil-A” kids meal experience.</description>
