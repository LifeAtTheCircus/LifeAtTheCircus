      <description>Every year when the circus comes to Baltimore, they do a special lunch with the elephants at the nearby Lexington Market. It’s a Baltimore tradition. And according to what I’ve read, Baltimore is the only city that hosts such an event annually. When I told the kids this, they said, “Well, at least Baltimore has one good thing about it.” Hahaha… these kids may have been born and raised in Maryland, but their blood runs black and gold….</description>
