      <description>A quick search through old posts and you will discover that I am a complete sap about gap toothed smiles. In my humble opinion, they are beyond precious and absolutely adorable. So, when our youngest lost his first tooth this week, I was completely smitten.
It’s been loose for awhile, but unlike my other children he wasn’t eager to pull it. No light saber pulling, or tying the tooth the the door knob.</description>

      <description>Since my oldest lost his first tooth, last spring, the tooth fairy has made 4 more visits to the circus. And judging by the giant front tooth dangling from my oldest sons top row, I think she’ll be back again this week!
As you may recall, we pulled my son’s first tooth in a very unconventional manner. His second tooth was pulled the normal way by dad. For his third tooth, he was very eager to pull it himself when his grandparents were here, so they could see.</description>
