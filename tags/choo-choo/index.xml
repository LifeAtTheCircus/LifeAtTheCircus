      <description>His favorite thing these days is Choo Choos. He was so excited at Target the other day when we went down the Thomas aisle. “Choo Choo right there” he pointed excitedly, over and over. 
He always sleeps with at least one choo choo in his hand and is super thrilled with the choo choo mattress sheet his Grandma made for him. He also LOVES to wear his choo choo shirt, or bathing suit.</description>
