      <description>All of my kids have enjoyed pushing the pretend mower along side their Daddy, but I do believe none of them have enjoyed it as much as our youngest. The look of absolute GLEE on his face when he hears Daddy say it’s time for him to go cut the grass is absolutely priceless. 
He even willingly will choose to stay behind with Dad to cut grass and meet the rest of us at the pool MISSING SOME SWIM TIME rather than miss the chance to cut the grass with his Dad.</description>

      <description>Last weekend was our Cub Scout Pack’s Pine Wood Derby race. It is one of the favorite Cub Scout traditions. Scott and our oldest son worked hard on the car.

My son had one focus: speed
He wanted his car to be as fast as possible. Whenever they discussed designs or modifications, speed was always his deciding factor. 


He designed his car to look like Bullet Bill from Wii Mario Kart.</description>
