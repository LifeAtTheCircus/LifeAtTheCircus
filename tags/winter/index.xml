      <description>I recall seeing something on Facebook before I went to bed about possible flash freezing or snow. But, I didn’t give it much thought.
When I woke up I peeked behind the curtain to see if anything came of it and I gasped. It was that big white puffy snow that sticks to the branches of trees. My most favorite kind of snowfall. And I laid in bed and watched it fall snuggling with my hubby and kids.</description>

      <description>I wasn’t aiming for some idealist, Kodak winter moment. Just an evening of winter fun with the kids. With the baby dropped off at my in laws, Scott and I set out for an evening on the ice with the big 3. Scott had his reservations and voiced them a few times. But, I was confident we’d be fine. 
Once we were all laced up and approaching the rink, my confidence began to waver.</description>
