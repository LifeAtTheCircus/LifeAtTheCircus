      <description>I know it isn’t very seasonal to have 66 degree weather the night of winter solstice. But I gotta confess I didn’t mind it one bit as that was the evening I’d been planning to take the kids to see the lights at Brookside Gardens. I had never been but heard someone talking about them once. Unlike other light displays, this one you park and get out and walk. Which could be a hard sell for 4 kids on a cold winter night.</description>
