      <description>This weekend we snuck away for to celebrate our anniversary. We spent the night in the nations capital. And we had a blast. No agenda. No plan. Just hanging out in DC just the two of us. Confession: I love the monuments in DC. Living in MD, I have seen them a lot. Growing up summer visits from cousins ALWAYS meant trips into DC. And I know they are very touristy.</description>

      <description>I really wanted to take the kids in to DC this spring to see the Cherry Blossoms. It’s not something we do every year, in fact, I think I’ve been only a handful of times in the 27 years I’ve lived in Maryland. But, this year, I thought it’d be fun to go and was thinking we might even have a free weekend during their peak blooms. But, thanks to the warm winter we had, they peaked early and there was NO chance of going during their peak week as it just didn’t fit with our schedules.</description>
