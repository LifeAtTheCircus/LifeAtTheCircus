      <description>My daughter is a fierce competitor. Everything, and I mean everything can be turned to a competition with her. Last weekend when we were driving back to the camp site from training camp, Scott and I drove my parents van and let my parents follow us with the kids in our van. We pulled in to Dairy Queen as a fun surprise and she says to my dad, “Now’s your chance to beat them… keep driving Papa!</description>

      <description>My oldest son is five. He’s gotten to the point where he wants things. And his birthday and Christmas are over. He’s already proven that he has the self control and discipline to save up for things. But he has no income.
I would like to start developing in him the discipline to save and to choose wisely how to spend his money. So, I was wondering, do any of you give your children allowances?</description>
