      <description>We set out from our friends in Iowa and headed north east. Our destination was the suburbs of Chicago. Scott and I visited Chicago last year for our anniversary and while I loved the city and would love to visit it again, we didn’t feel this was the trip to take the family into the city. Instead we planned a stop at Lego Discovery Center outside of the city.</description>

      <description>The kids and I started reading the Chronicles of Narnia a few weeks ago. I finished reading them The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe and we’re now onto Prince Caspian . The truth is, I’ve never read these books before, so I am just as interested and captivated as my oldest son is. The other day during quiet time the oldest two kids started walking back and forth between their separate areas… eventually they asked if they could play quietly together and I let them as long as they stayed quiet.</description>
