      <description>One day my 4 year old came to me with about 8 pony tail holders and asked me to put them all in her hair. I was surprised with how cute it turned out and she was excited when she received compliments on it from her friend at church. After realizing how well it stayed in, I decided it might be worth trying this for gymnastics. (this is it after a night of sleep)</description>

      <description>Exciting things are happening round the circus parts this week and it’s only Tuesday!!
Sunday, I ran a half marathon with my FIL. My friend, who had to run a half marathon in order to see me in real life, also ran but she was so stinking fast that I am glad I caught her in line for the potty before the race, b/c there was no seeing her after that.</description>

      <description>“Momma, don’t we look beautiful?”
As I praised them for their lovely fashion choices and snapped picture upon picture of their dress up fun, it dawned on me that this was an opportunity to reinforce what true beauty is. Ya know, I said. To be truly beautiful, you have to be kind and loving to others. In fact, you can be wearing the prettiest dress ever, but if you act mean and unkind to others, you aren’t beautiful.</description>

      <description>I’ve already confessed quite a few of my fashion fashion fo paws for you here on the good ol blog. Why not add another to the list? (I’m really just secretly hoping that Stacy and Clinton will come whisk me away and give me a brand new ward robe to enjoy with my post baby body… ah, wouldn’t that be nice)…
But, back to reality…
I am afraid that perhaps I know where my daughter got her bold fashion sense from.</description>

      <description>As the kids and I frolicked around the local farm park with friends the other day, I couldn’t help but smirk at my youngest in her “farm girl” attire.

As she eagerly peeked in on the baby piglets in with her dazzling shades and hot pink purse…

 She wrinkled her nose and said, “Mommy, something is stinky!”
 I couldn’t help but think of Za Za Gabor in Green Acres.</description>

      <title>Cross Country Fashion Consult</title>

      <description>As I’ve already made well aware, I am not exactly a fashion guru. You won’t find me flipping through the pages of Cosmopolitan in my free time. My nails are rarely done and my idea of styling my hair involves taking the time to blow dry rather than air dry.
I wanted to look cute when Scott and I went on a date a few weeks ago. I was so excited because my friend had just lent me some adorable maternity clothes so I didn’t really give my thought to my wardrobe till about 30 min before we were going to leave when I began to change.</description>
