      <description>This afternoon after church we took the kids to the county’s Public Safety Expo. The Police and Fire Departments for the country put on an INCREDIBLE expo. It was both fun and educational.
I think going into it my oldest son was a little like, “big deal we are going to see fire trucks” while my 3 year old was all “WAHOO We are going to see Fire Trucks” but everyone was surprised by all we got to see and do.</description>
