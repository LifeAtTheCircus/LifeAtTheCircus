      <description>Every year I have high hopes for being on top of things in the Christmas season. Last year, as hard as I tried, I was no where near on top of things. In fact, my Christmas cards became New Years cards and weren’t even mailed till the middle of January. 
This year, however, I have high hopes. Thanks to a special promotion from Shutterfly, I have already designed my Christmas cards!</description>
