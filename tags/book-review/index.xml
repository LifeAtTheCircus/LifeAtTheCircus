      <description>Years ago my Mom and I attended a Women of Faith Conference…I believe our first was when I was in college. We drove to Cleveland, OH to attend the conference. We left refreshed and inspired and vowing to make it a tradition to attend some sort of spiritual conference together as often as we could. Since then, we’ve attend Women of Faith, Beth Moore, and a few women’s retreats together. I appreciate the opportunity to worship, and grow alongside my mom.</description>

      <description>It happened again…I sat curled up on the couch, reading page after page of Solomon’s Puzzle, until before I knew it, the clock struck midnight. While I didn’t turn into a pumpkin, it did make waking up the next morning rather difficult… especially coupled with nursing a sick baby. Yes, I hold Loris Nebbia, author of Solomon’s Puzzle, strictly responsible for the fact that my son was late for his tutorial twice last week.</description>

      <description>Sometimes in the chaos of finding baseball gloves and missing cleats, in the midst of grocery shopping and read alouds, sometimes if your not careful, it is all too easy to miss the point. In the midst of doing so many good and important things, you can neglect to focus on the main purpose of it all. Irecently had a the opportunity to read and review the book One Million Arrows by Julie Ferwerda.</description>

      <description>In the interest of keeping it real, I’m going to tell you that I have not really been much for the whole green fad that has swept my generation. While we do recycle, that’s about the extent of it. Then a few years ago my pastor gave a sermon during a series on stewardship that hit home for me. He talked about the fact that while God did make the world for us to enjoy and inhabit, it didn’t mean he made it for us to squander and trash.</description>

      <description>When it comes to books and movies, one favorite category of mine is crime drama. If the back cover mentions CIA, FBI, or any other government agency, you can bet I’d give it a try. I was quite excited when I had the opportunity to read an advanced copy of [Lis Wiehl’s](http://www.liswiehlbooks.com/ .) book Hand of Fate and review it on my blog. The book centers on 3 friends, (one a crime reporter, one a federal prosecutor, and the other an FBI agent) as they work together to solve the death of radio talk show personality, Jim Fate.</description>

      <description>When Scott and I were engaged everyone was reading this book. While we never sat down and read the book we did peruse the chapter headings to determine what the 5 love languages were and it didn&amp;rsquo;t take long for us to figure out which love language each of us spoke. We will both tell you that this is the best marriage book we ever didn&amp;rsquo;t read. The concepts in this book have truly helped our marriage.</description>

      <description>I finished a book this weekend. It is called Tending Roses by Lisa Wingate. The book really touched me on many levels. I think I could relate to the main character somewhat b/c I too am a mom with small children. The main character spends 3 weeks living with her grandma after her grandma has suffered a stroke. Her grandma records some life lessons in a notebook which she leaves out on the table for her to find.</description>
