      <description>Dear Children of Mine,
10 years from now when you are wondering what in the world to get Mom for Christmas, I have an idea for you. So write it down and stick it away and remember it when your 19, 17, 16, and 13. All I want for Christmas, is you. It’s true… nothing wrapped under the tree could possible come close to time spent with you. So, if you really want to make my day, ask me if we can make sugar cookies together.</description>

      <description>Not sure which I like best about this snapshot, the smiles on the girls faces, my daughters hand in the peanut butter jar or my son sneaking yet another lick out of the bowl….</description>

      <description>The most favorite Christmas cookie for the circus fam to make is sugar cookies. Messiness + sugar = pure bliss for the circus crew!!


  This year we enjoyed rolling and cutting the cookies with our cousin Eli. 

 It was also the first year that the youngest circus crew member got to participate in the cooking making fun. And by participate, I of course mean, eating.</description>
