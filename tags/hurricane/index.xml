      <description>For many north of us on the east coast, Sandy was more than an adventure… it was a catastrophe. It was devastation. It was unlike anything I have ever seen first hand or experienced. So, I hesitate to even really blog about our adventure… b/c for us… that’s what it was, an adventure. An escape from the normal day to day living for a few days. A “Staycation” if you will.</description>

      <description>Why hello, dear neglected blog of mine… yes, the circus family is still alive and well. It’s just been a busy week at the circus, what with an earthquake, a hurricane, a Women of Faith conference (another blog post to come about that soon), a head cold, a fantasy football draft and home schooling….
