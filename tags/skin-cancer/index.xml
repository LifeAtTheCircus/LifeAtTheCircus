      <description>I had to have surgery this week to remove a skin cancer spot on my nose. Having gone through skin cancer a few other times, I naively thought it was going to be no big deal. So, I went into the surgery center very low key. I couldn’t believe how many people were in the waiting room when I arrived for my 7:45 AM appointment, but since I was the youngest one there by a good 40 years or so, I am guessing this is normal.</description>
