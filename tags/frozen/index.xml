      <description>It has been C-O-L-D this past week here in MD. I heard rumors that parts of the bay and various rivers and inlets were freezing. So, this afternoon we took the kids out to see for ourselves. At one of the beaches we visited these ice balls had formed in the river. I had actually seen pictures of them floating earlier this week. Now the ice balls are frozen in to the ice.</description>
