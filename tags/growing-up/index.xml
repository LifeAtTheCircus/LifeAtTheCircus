      <description>A quick search through old posts and you will discover that I am a complete sap about gap toothed smiles. In my humble opinion, they are beyond precious and absolutely adorable. So, when our youngest lost his first tooth this week, I was completely smitten.
It’s been loose for awhile, but unlike my other children he wasn’t eager to pull it. No light saber pulling, or tying the tooth the the door knob.</description>

      <description>It’s hard to believe that my youngest will be school age next year. Seriously, how did that happen? Sometimes when we drop the big kids off at their tutorial on “school at the building days” he will pause outside the Kindergarten room and tell me, “That’s where I go next year Momma and then you will be all alone and so sad.” And my heart kinda breaks a little. Because he is right.</description>

      <description>Our youngest child had his first soccer practice this week. 
As I struggled to put him into his shin guards and knee socks and cleats, all while watching him grin from ear to ear, my mind drifted back to going through this same right of passage with his older siblings….
Fall 2009


Fall 2010


Spring 2011


Gosh…. look at all those chubby cheeks and teeny tiny legs chasing after those soccer balls….</description>

      <description>We recently celebrated my youngest sons birthday. Because he shares his birthday with our anniversary, we often celebrate his birthday over Memorial Day weekend… So, in his book he is 4 now though technically there are still a few more days till that occurs officially. I love this age… 3/4&amp;hellip; I love how his personality is developing as well as his sense of humor. I love how his vocabulary is growing and he tries out new words, many big words and he misuses them.</description>

      <description>Spring weather arrived this weekend. We literally spent the entire day outside on Sunday (other than the time we were in Sunday School and church). It was wonderfully refreshing. A friend from church passed down a toddler bike with training wheels. My littlest guy was so excited to ride a big kid bike. 
I was impressed with how quickly he caught on to peddling. After two trips around the court, he could start himself, steer, and even ring his bell while peddling.</description>

      <description>…she is fierce.”
That William Shakespeare quote has always reminded me of my oldest daughter. She’s small in stature but strong in will and spirit.
She turned 8 this week. I am proud of the girl she’s growing up to be. She’s not much like me. So many of her strengths are my weaknesses.
She’s logical and practical. She tells things like it is and is a no nonsense kind of gal.</description>

      <description>This wasn’t the first time my oldest daughter played the part of Super Girl for Halloween. 4 years ago she had the same role.
2009

2013

She tells me that when she’s 11 she plans to be Super Girl again… guess we are on an every 4 year rotation with this role. </description>

      <description>She’s been wiggling that tooth for weeks now… hoping and hoping it was ready to pull. I could see the tip of the new one peeking through behind it so I figured it was time for it to come out.
Daddy always does the honors round here, so she sweetly begged Daddy to pull it this morning before leaving for work. 

Part way in Scott realized that maybe that tooth wasn’t as ready to come out as we thought.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago Scott and I attended the wedding of a friend of ours from high school. As we sat there watching, I had this rather startling realization. Weddings are different for me now than they used to be. I can remember going to wedding for friends when we were in college. As I rejoiced with our friends over the start of their life together, I also found myself taking note of things I’d like to do in my own wedding “someday.</description>

      <description>I love the age of 3. I really feel like the personality of your child fully starts to emerge at 3. And 3 year olds are funny. I love their sense of humor and logic and cute little mispronounciations. And they start to pretend. 3 is really fabulous in my humble opinion and I am most def going to mourn the passage of time when I no longer have a 3 year old in the house.</description>

      <description>I love the ever changing smiles on my kiddos faces as they lose teeth and then gain new/big teeth. Over the past month or so my 7 year old lost 3 teeth… the latest one to come out was last night. 
She’s starting to look older to me lately…</description>

      <description>This weekend we celebrated our youngest daughter’s 6th birthday. Since her reoccurring theme of the year was all things feline, it came as no surprise to me when she requested we have a cat themed birthday party. Because she doesn’t like cake, she requested brownies with little plastic cats on each one. (For real, those were her exact words) I was more than happy to grant that simple request. (hands down easiest birthday cake I’ve done for one of my kids)</description>

      <description>Our littlest man was so, so excited about his third birthday. I wish there was some way to truly capture his joy and eager anticipation. He talked about his party daily since his brothers birthday in April. He’d tell me the date of his birthday and that he was turning “free” and that he wanted a choo choo cake, and a choo choo balloon, and a present, and a party. Then after his Daddy had his birthday in late May and had to leave to go to a meeting on his birthday, he then would add that he wanted a meeting on his birthday too.</description>

      <description>That’s right, today is our last day of school at the building. 
As we prepare to leap into summer… let’s take a quick peek back at day 1.

Look how much they’ve grown just physically this year! I can’t believe it’s our last day of Kindergarten, 1st grade, an 3rd grade.

They got to dress down for the last day of school. (Can you tell it’s been a chilly spring?</description>

      <description>When you have a baby people offer you all sorts of odd, unsolicited, terrifying, and often contradictory pieces of advice. One that I have heard over and over the past 9 years is “Don’t blink.”
And I have tried really hard not to.
I have tried really hard to savor the chaos. It’s a large part of the reason why I blog. I want to record the every day. The funny things they say, the crazy outfits they pick out, the battles we engage in, the toys they love… and yes, even the unending laundry pile, and the sink overflowing with dishes… Because I know what those who have gone before me have told me is true… the days are long, but the years are quick.</description>

      <description>So, it turns out we have a sneak here at the circus.
Yes, behind this adorable smile is actually a rather devious little chocolate hoarder. Earlier this week the kids received a package of chocolate from their cousins for Valentines day. I let them all have one after lunch and then we put the box up on the counter for later. Later that evening when the kids wanted another piece after dinner the box was no where to be found.</description>

      <description>While he’s been interested in going on the potty for awhile now… even going on his own every once and awhile, I haven’t yet been reading to dive full in to the potty training process with my youngest. Just last week I was talking to a friend about our 2 year olds and I told her &amp;quot;I am not ready yet.” Because potty training is a lot of work. It takes time and patience and flexibility.</description>

      <description>Number one sign you have a 2 year old boy in the house.
Nothing is safe. He will drag chairs to the counter to score out of reach cookies, he’ll fill cups with ice only to dump them on the floor, he’ll drink soda, coffee, whatever he finds left sitting out with reckless abandon. And he’ll sunscreen my dining room furniture. 
I had even seen the sunscreen lying out earlier and moved it to the center of the dining room table, “just incase”….</description>

      <description>She’s my free spirit.
My morning girl.
My glass half full child. She loves to create… always drawing, writing letters or pictures, doodling on any paper she can find. She’s very verbal. When I put her in her room for quiet time, I often think someone has snuck in there with her b/c I hear her talking away—only to discover she’s talking to her self, or reciting things she heard on the radio or TV.</description>

      <description>His favorite thing these days is Choo Choos. He was so excited at Target the other day when we went down the Thomas aisle. “Choo Choo right there” he pointed excitedly, over and over. 
He always sleeps with at least one choo choo in his hand and is super thrilled with the choo choo mattress sheet his Grandma made for him. He also LOVES to wear his choo choo shirt, or bathing suit.</description>

      <description>Years ago Aunt Karen gave our oldest child a Life is Good soccer shirt. Because the color and theme were gender neutral, I ended up passing it down to my daughter a few years later. It actually became that perfect shirt for younger siblings to wear to soccer games so she could feel like she was a part of the team too. By the time my third child wore it, it was worn with shin guards and sometimes even cleats TO WATCH the older 2 practice.</description>

      <description>Sooooo much life has been happenin’ round here these past few weeks, I honestly don’t know where or how to start with chronicling it all. But, lest he get ANY older, I thought I’d pause in the midst of unpacking to comment on the birthday of my youngest. Because folks, sometime in the midst of packing, remodeling, moving, and unpacking… this little guy turned 2!! But, more than that, just like I feared, the little man grew up when we moved to the new house.</description>

      <description>I remember vividly the first night we spent in our house. We were first time home owners.
And we were giddy. As we lay on the floor in our bedroom looking up at the ceiling I remember Scott commenting on the ceiling fan. “Look at that ceiling fan! We own it!” I on the other hand couldn’t get my eyes of the red blinking light from the smoke detector…. wondering how would I fall asleep with it constantly blinking.</description>

      <description>For the past four and half years, this has been her “go to” position for comfort. 
As a baby it was great… she totally self soothed… no pacifiers to chase down or beloved blankey to snuggle. Just pop her index and middle fingers in her mouth backwards and start rubbing her ear (or twirling her hair) and she could instantly calm herself to sleep. We knew of course this would have it’s trade off.</description>

      <description>This past week our oldest son turned 8. As quickly as that time seems to have flown, it is frightening to me to realize in just as little time, he’ll be waving goodbye as he backs a car out of the driveway. AACK! In the midst of this busy stage of life, I want to take time to reflect on who he is now at this stage, so I can cherish and savor it for years to come.</description>

      <description>It’s been really neat to watch the bond between my oldest and youngest. Our baby was the answer to his older brothers prayers, as he longed to have a little brother. I’ll never forget the look of pure joy when he found out he finally had a baby brother. I know he can’t wait for the day when they can truly play together, but for now it is so neat to see the love between them blossom.</description>

      <description>I baby him.
A lot.
I know I never, ever babied any of my others like I do him. It’s mostly because I know he’s my last, but also because he lets me. He weighs 27 lbs

and will be 2 in three months, and yet most days you’ll find me carrying him on my hip. I joked the other day that you’ll probably find me carrying him in to kindergarten.</description>

      <description>My oldest daughter turns 6 this week.
6 years old.
It just sound so old… so, not a baby, not a toddler, not a preschooler, but a… girl. I spent some time looking back at pictures and videos this past year and I realized that 5 is a significant year. She grew up A LOT this past year.
She started school.
She learned to read.
She learned to add and subtract.</description>

      <description>Truthfully, the circus family doesn’t spend much time on bikes. We do a lot of fun things here, don’t get me wrong, but there are only so many hours in a day, and teaching our kids to ride bikes has not been where we’ve spent ours.
But, today the sun was shining, the weather was unseasonably warm here in MD again, and as the kids played in the backyard while Scott did yard work, our oldest daughter decided that today she wanted to ride her bike without training wheels.</description>

      <description>When I uploaded my last video to you tube, I got side tracked with a little trip down memory lane as I then watched other videos the circus fam has posted to you tube in the past.
And I came across this gem.
A few things I noticed while re watching the video.
1. My oldest son used to have that cute 4 year old voice you swear you’ll never forget but inevitably do.</description>

      <description>Our oldest daughter had a little fun getting into her character for Halloween. When posing for pictures in their costumes, she decided to fully act out the part of Snow White.

I think my favorite part of the reenactment was when she asked us to take her picture sleeping with the apple. &amp;quot;Skip the ol posing by the door with the trick or treat basket, we’ll go for playing dead on the floor with an apple.</description>

      <description>September 27th—He’s officially walking.. No longer just two or three steps then fall down, but plodding on his own across a room before he stumbles.
October 7th- 10 days later -
 Watch out world! This boy is ready to play.</description>

      <description>My lil man reached a major milestone today as he played in the sand. We’ve been going to the beach, splashing in the water and playing in the sand all summer long. And all summer long he has wanted to put fist full upon fist full of sand into his mouth. You’d think eventually cause and effect would come in to play, but he never seemed to mind the mouth full of grit.</description>

      <description>My youngest daughter turns 4 this week. I often joke that she was born trying to keep up with her sister and brother. It’s true though. She is always ahead of where she should be b/c she has never wanted to be left behind. As such, whenever her birthday rolls around I don’t have that typical, “How can it have been 4 yrs already?” feeling, more often we’re like, “Really, your just now 4… seems like you’ve been 4 for awhile now.</description>

      <description>While looking through pictures recently, I stumbled across a few which truly captured life at the circus in its essence.
Exhibit A: taken in December of 2010

Here they are working on the pine wood derby car for Cub Scouts. Notice how everyone, even the baby, is in on the action? Noticed the leotard? My girls wear leotards every.single.day…. even though gymnastics is only twice a week, I can guarantee you those leotards are on more often than that.</description>

      <description>Ya know that feeling you get when you look at your kids and you just wanna freeze time? You don’t want them to grow up, not one bit, so you just try your best to hold on to the moments while you can.
Well, we figured out a way to freeze time here at the circus…just a little…

Our littlest crew member turned one earlier this month. Not sure how that year flew by so fast.</description>

Every now and then I will see blog title under One Year Ago and it will catch my eye. I think that tab alone is the motivation for me to keep blogging lately.</description>

      <description>While we’re making him wait till the end of the month to savor his first taste of cake (at his party when his grandparents can be there to ooh and aah), we couldn’t let his day go by without some sort of yummy mess. Enter baby’s first donut for breakfast.

First, he ate each individual sprinkle off of the donut. 

Then, it was time to ditch the hat, and tack a dab at the icing… again using his fingers to scrape it clean.</description>

      <description>I don’t share the kids names on the blog… but ya wanna know a secret? If our youngest son, had been a girl, her name would have been Joy. And as I reflected on that recently, I couldn’t help but think what a perfect word that is for our little man.
He truly is Joy personified.
Never have I seen a more happy, more contented, more easy going baby. He showers us all with laughs and smiles.</description>

      <description>There were moments, many moments, this year when I doubted. I wondered if I was giving him what he needed, if he was on par with where the public school was. I wondered what I was thinking, was it worth the battles, and the mess around my house. Days when I shoved school work aside as I put dinner on the table before quickly rushing out the door for practice. Truthfully, the hardest thing for me is the mess… is letting the mess go so we can concentrate on school work.</description>

      <description>One of my very first blog posts ever was on my children’s love of kidney beans. It is now 3 years later and my girls have moved on to baked beans. Seriously, the love my daughter has for baked beans can NOT be overstated. Last week I figured it was time to try the kidney beans out on number 4. (let the playgroup mocking begin).


What do you mean I shouldn’t eat too many at once?</description>

      <description>The time had finally come for the tooth to be pulled. While our son was more than ready for it to come out, Dad was secretly uneasy about the venture. “He trusts me” Scott confided to me in the hallway, “What if I hurt him?” Then Scott got another one of his moments of sheer fatherhood brilliance.
“I’ll let him do it,” he declared.
He tied one end of the dental floss to his light saber and the other to his tooth.</description>

      <description>Exciting things are happening round the circus parts this week and it’s only Tuesday!!
Sunday, I ran a half marathon with my FIL. My friend, who had to run a half marathon in order to see me in real life, also ran but she was so stinking fast that I am glad I caught her in line for the potty before the race, b/c there was no seeing her after that.</description>

      <description>Reading has not come without its share of battles and tears for my son. Last year, he truly HATED to read and it was such a struggle for us. I at times found myself wondering if I was really meeting his needs by homeschooling. Part of me kept telling myself, “He is a boy. He’ll get it, it just takes time. Don’t worry.” But another part said, “Am I doing a good enough job?</description>

      <description>My lil guy isn’t a newborn anymore. I’ve known it for awhile.. he’s eating solids, vocalizing, and working on crawling. But, recently, I also realized his days of simply sleeping in my arms are fleeting. He’s working himself into a rhythm… sleeping through the night… taking 2 solid naps a day…The days of just holding my tiny, sleeping newborn in my arms are over. So on those random Sunday afternoons when he falls asleep in my arms, I am going to stay put and savor the moment.</description>

      <description>Dishes piled in the sink, pjs on till 2:00 in the afternoon, laundry waiting to be folded, counter cluttered…
But today, it doesn’t bother me. (ok, it doesn’t bother me too much anyway)…
because…
Today, I finally took the time to snuggle on the couch with my almost 5 year old and work with her on reading… and today that precious light bulb went off as she first went up and down the blend ladders and then graduated to three letter words.</description>

      <description>Ever year it is the same… I beg and plead for just one small Christmas Eve miracle, a picture of my kids in front of the tree. The last few years as they’ve gotten older, it has actually gotten easier, thanks to a slight guilt trip from Daddy (do this for Mommy please, as your Christmas gift to her). I thought it might be fun after sharing this years picture to look back on Christmas’s Past.</description>

      <description>You’d think doing this 3 times over already, I would have been prepared.

And yet, once again, my breath has been taken away. I have fallen, and hard.
 
With your irresistible smile, your easy going personality, and your snuggly hugs, I am smitten. 
How can it be that 6 months have already passed since you joined our family? In some ways it seems like you were just born yesterday and in others it seems like you’ve always been a part of our family.</description>

      <description>It became quite clear to us that our little man was ready to try solid foods when he started opening his mouth like a baby bird anytime we were eating with him on our lap. We couldn’t help but laugh when he started reaching out for Daddy’s fork, mouth wide open, just begging for a taste.

Here he is holding our Smores ingredients while on vacation… his poor pathetic face seems to be saying, “They aren’t even nice about it!</description>

      <description>Our third born has literally been on the fast track since birth. I swear she was born holding her head up and eagerly chasing after her older 2 siblings, not wanting to be left out for even a second. She was clearly not meant to be the “baby” of the family.

Most of the time when my kids celebrate a birthday, I find myself reflecting on how quickly time passes and marveling at how could they be so old so fast.</description>

      <description>6 years ago, I was also carrying a baby in my belly. (In fact, this picture was taken exactly 6 yrs ago to the date). The nursery was prepped, the hospital bag had long been packed. I was basically sitting around waiting to have a baby. I do not recommend going with that strategy… what a long week of waiting that was. Now I try to plan things right up to and past the due date, so I am not in that hurry up and wait mode.</description>

      <description>The other day my son told me he wanted to make all of us breakfast the next morning. The only problem with this very sweet gesture was that it was the end of the month and we were at the “creative” stage of the month/meal plan.
Bread? No
Milk? No
Cereal? No
Not much available for a 5 yr old to fix, so I convinced him to wait till after I went grocery shopping on Monday.</description>

      <description>When I came out to the kitchen to make breakfast this morning, I felt a cold draft. I then noticed my son sitting in the sliding glass door. 
He told me he was listening to the birds in the backyard. They were offering up a beautiful melody. One thing I love about life with small children is that they help you to stop and take notice of the everyday miracles in the world around you.</description>

      <description>I’ve been putting it off for far too long (as you can soon tell by my before picture). But today I decided that my poor girl was past due for a hair cut. We’ve cut her bangs, but nothing major since what I refer to as the “debacle of 07” when I took my sweet 22 mth old for a hair cut and returned with a sweet little girl sporting the bowl cut.</description>

      <description>Every now and then at the circus, I find myself enjoying a moment of peace. All too often that peace and quiet is the result of complete and massive destruction going on quietly in another room of the house… say an overflowing sink, or crayon art on the wall, or something else which seems to bind my children in complete quiet. But sometimes, sometimes all is calm and when I fearfully peek around the corner, I catch a moment like this.</description>

      <description>Something happened to my baby girl.
Seems she was just learning to crawl.
How is that she’s running around, skinning her knees and swinging beside the big kids?
