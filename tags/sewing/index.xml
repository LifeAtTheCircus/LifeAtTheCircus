      <description>As I left the house for my second sewing class I eagerly told Scott I’d return with 2 aprons in hand. I recall him lovingly tried to temper my expectations by suggesting even returning with one would be exciting, but I blew him off as ran out the door material, machine, and new sewing scissors in hand. I returned 3 hours later having sewed the neck strap for one of my aprons.</description>

      <description>I do not consider myself to be either creative or crafty. And most of the time I am ok with that. Even though my mom and grandma are both talented seamstresses, I’ve often joked that I missed out on the sewing gene.
The truth is that sewing seems to require patience and an aspiration for perfection. And for me, close enough is usually more than good enough. But close enough doesn’t seem to work when sewing, b/c you kinda want your dresses to be straight and your sleeves even.</description>
