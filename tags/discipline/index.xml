&amp;quot;Ew, gross!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I don&amp;rsquo;t like it!&amp;quot; How many of you have had this response after working hard to prepare a new dish for you family? It can be quite frustrating especially if you know they&amp;rsquo;ll like it b/c they like every single one of the ingredients in it or worse yet, they devoured it the last time you made it and now won&amp;rsquo;t even try it.
My husband and I have always insisted the our kids at least try a bite of whatever it is we&amp;rsquo;re eating.</description>

      <description>Yesterday when we were out running errands my son told me,
&amp;ldquo;Mom, I am going to be really good at nap time today.&amp;rdquo;
I was in the midst of trying to find the things on my mental list and push the cart with three kids on it, so I muttered something like, &amp;ldquo;good honey&amp;rdquo; and continued on. My son was so excited because after nap time we were going to plant flowers in our yard.</description>
