      <description>The highlight of our day at the Grand Canyon for most of the members of our circus crew was a short hike they took into the canyon. 
We all started on the hike, but it was more than this “fraid’ of heights Momma” could handle. The plan was to go to the first tunnel and back, but after about 2 treks on the switchback, I was biting back tears and hating EVERY second of it.</description>
