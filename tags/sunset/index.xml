      <description>Tuesday we left New Mexico and headed south west for Saguaro National Park in Tuscon, AZ.

We got to Saguaro National Park in time to explore a bit and then take in the parks beauty after the oppressive heat of the day was past. It really was perfect timing. We walked around a path near the visitors center which allowed us to see the cacti up close. 
The cacti were much bigger than we expected and we were delighted to find some in bloom.</description>

      <description>The sun’s rays cast a bright orange glow on the rocks when it rose in the morning.

As the day went on, the bees came out to pollinate the flora.

As the day progressed, we were able to pose for the very significant sign shot. Click here to learn of it’s high importance.

As the sun began to set the rocks began to change color yet again.</description>
