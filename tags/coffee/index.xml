      <description>This weekend marked an anniversary of a life changing event in my life. In fact, one could say that my life is very, very different as a result of it.
2 years ago while on our annual Labor Day cabin trip I did something I had never done before. I finished a cup of coffee.
Sure, I had had a sip once or twice, hoping to like it like my friends… but I never really cared for it.</description>

      <description>It began innocently enough. It kind of drew me in with its rich, sweet aroma. For years I’d enjoy the hint of the flavor… in mud pies or Frappuccino&amp;rsquo;s…even an occasional cappuccino. But I wasn’t quite ready to sell out and drink a cup of joe for breakfast on a regular occasion. Then I went to our annual Labor Day getaway. Which, in addition to being a house full of my closest life long friends and their chillin’, was also a house full of serious coffee drinkers.</description>
