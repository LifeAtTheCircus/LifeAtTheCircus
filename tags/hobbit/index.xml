      <description>We celebrated our son’s 9th birthday this weekend at the Shire. Our son has been quite taken by The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings this year. His attention was sparked by the Lego LOTR game, then Scott and him read the Hobbit and he is now reading The Fellowship of the Ring. For his cake, he requested a volcano to look like Mt. Doom.

The kids pulled together some costumes… We have from left to right, Gimli, Frodo, Samwise Gamgee, and Aragorn.</description>
