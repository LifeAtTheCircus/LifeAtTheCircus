      <description>The internet is a funny thing. I know there are a million and one articles out their all over face book about parents and kids being too distracted… about the negative side effects of being on facebook and blogging… and well, this is not one of them. Nor is this going to be an article in defense of face book or blogging. Truthfully, like just about EVERY SINGLE OTHER MAJOR ISSUE plaguing Momma’s these days, I kinda think moderation is the key… and I also really don’t enjoy debating… so I just kinda stay out of it.</description>

      <description>I feel busy… these past few months have probably been the busiest I’ve been in quite awhile. Scott worked a ton of overtime, the oldest three played soccer, the girls both did gymnastics, my oldest son started piano lessons, cub scouts is back in action, the home school year began—it takes up way more of my day than it used to…. I am not complaining… I willingly signed up for all of these things (ok… except for the overtime part) and I enjoy them… it’s a stage of life for us that is fleeting, I know.</description>

      <description>It’s been ** 2 ** years since I began writing “Life At The Circus.”
** 2 ** years and 654 posts
2 years, can you believe it? I can’t.
When I look back at my first posts, I laugh at how much my life has changed… and how much it hasn’t. It’s the end of the month and I gotta tell you, my fridge looks pretty much exactly the same as it did here two years ago.</description>

      <description>I saw this line on a tee shirt this weekend at the Annapolis 10 Mile and loved it. But, it cost $27 so I decided instead of buying the tee shirt, I’d make it my blog title. Yea, I was so excited when I signed up back in June to run this race with my high school friends. And somehow 3 months came and went and I ummm didn’t really train adequately for it.</description>

      <title>A Real Friend</title>

      <description>I write to you today with a happy heart. 3 days ago my bloggy world and my real life world collided at lunch in Pittsburgh. As I drove to my meeting place, I was a bit nervous. “What if we run out of things to say? Will she like me when she meets me in person?” It felt quite similar to those first date jitters. (No I wasn’t worried about whether or not she’d kiss me when she dropped me off at the end).</description>
