      <description>As a mom, there are several roles I play in the lives of my children. One of my favorite roles is that of cheer leader. I truly enjoy watching them compete/perform in whatever activity they are involved in and cheering them on as they do so. Yes, that’s right. I am that Mom you hear above the crowd cheering and squealing. This fall my son began a new sport. After years of wanting to try martial arts, he started Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.</description>
