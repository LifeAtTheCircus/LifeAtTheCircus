      <description>What a Night!

We had a super fun Halloween evening this year and I am thankful we got to know several of our neighbors better. This year we had
Harry Potter 
Super Girl (yes she has been Supergirl for 1/3 of our Halloween’s but what can I say, the girl likes being super girl) This year she changed it up and went with pink super girl though.</description>

      <description>We carved our pumpkins tonight….


My second born has always been my tactile child. She loves getting her hands messy… she’s the one who loves the feel of dirt on her skin and apparently is also fond of pumpkin guts on her fingers. She happily squished and sorted seeds.

Her sister was less thrilled with the feel of pumpkin guts on her hands.

But,we were all happy with how the jack-o-lanterns turned out.</description>

      <description>This wasn’t the first time my oldest daughter played the part of Super Girl for Halloween. 4 years ago she had the same role.
2009

2013

She tells me that when she’s 11 she plans to be Super Girl again… guess we are on an every 4 year rotation with this role. </description>

      <description>It was our first time trick or treating in the new neighborhood and I gotta say it felt weird this year not doing it with our neighbor like we’ve done for the past several years. It wasn’t the same.
Still we had a good time dressing up as our favorite characters and chowing down on candy bar after candy bar when we got home. We let the kids go all in and devour their loot when they got home… then we let that sugar coma set in while we vegged on the couch with a little Charlie Brown and the Great Pumpkin.</description>

      <description>Our oldest daughter had a little fun getting into her character for Halloween. When posing for pictures in their costumes, she decided to fully act out the part of Snow White.

I think my favorite part of the reenactment was when she asked us to take her picture sleeping with the apple. &amp;quot;Skip the ol posing by the door with the trick or treat basket, we’ll go for playing dead on the floor with an apple.</description>

      <description>What do you get when you combine
1 founding father

2 princesses

and one super hero?

Enough candy to last you till Easter!

One last question: How many licks does it take to get to the center of Tootsie Pop?</description>
