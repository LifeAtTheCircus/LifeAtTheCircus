      <description>We got our tree today!!! 
We started decorating the house yesterday, but it wasn’t quite right without the tree. I don’t think our three year old remembers the Christmas tree b/c after we cut it down and tied it to our van he asked, “Can we keep it in our yard as our Christmas tree?” He had no idea it would go in the house. And then when we added lights, he was beyond excited.</description>

      <description>When cutting down a tree, much like when shopping for a dress, there seems to be an unwritten rule of conduct.
No matter how fabulous it looks, you simply can’t go with the first one you see.
One simply can’t drive to the farm, march down the aisle, and stop at the first decent looking spruce you see.
That would be far too easy. Where would the fun be in that?</description>
