      <description>This trip seems to be all about extremes and remoteness. Channel Islands National Park is a group of islands located off the coast of Los Angeles. A visit here gives one a glimpse of what the California coast looked like before it was overpopulated with humanity. You can find vegetation and wild life here that doesnâ€™t exist anywhere else. The signature element of the park however is the rocky cliffs along the waters edge and the marine life.</description>
