      <description>This February the girls had their very first international meet in Orlando Florida!

And since the meet happened to be only 10 minutes from Universal Studios, we decided to add a day of Family Fun at Universal Studios before heading home from Florida.

Our oldest son has read the entire Harry Potter series more than once as well as some of the “bonus books” like Fantastical Beasts and Quidditch Through the Ages… child number two got into the Harry Potter phase this fall and is currently reading book 5.</description>
