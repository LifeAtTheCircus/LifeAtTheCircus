      <description>I have friends that are super awesome yard salers. They get up at the butt crack of dawn on Saturday morning and drive all over the county finding great deals. They truly impress me and sometimes I think I want to be them, b/c I too like getting good deals.
But, I don’t like getting up at the butt crack of dawn any day of the week, much less Saturday. And I especially don’t like dragging 4 kids around with me all over the county at the butt crack of dawn, worse yet having the kids see stuff that other people are clearing out of their house and begging me if they can then bring it in mine and then me coming home without the outdoor patio table and chairs I’d been wanting but with a bag full of happy meal toys that are now going to clutter up our family room floor.</description>
