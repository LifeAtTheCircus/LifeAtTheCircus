      <description>This weekend the family went on a Cub Scout camp out from Friday- Saturday evening. The kids have been begging to go camping again, and this over nighter was the perfect little get away for us. As an added convenience it was at a State Park not far from our house, so it was quite easy to pop home if you needed something and made it no big deal when we got a late start on Friday night.</description>

      <description>They’ve tried piers, ponds, worms, and lures. For three summers now he’s patiently pursued it. Casting and waiting. Enjoying the view and the time together. Each time, I’d ask if he had a good time. Each time he’d enthusiastically respond, “Yes!” Then I’d ask if he got a keeper and each time he’d respond in the negative. He’s caught a fish a few times, but not the illustrious keeper he sought after.</description>
