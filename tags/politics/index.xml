      <description>It’s that time again… the mailers, the prerecorded phone calls, and those signs covering any square inch of grass on the side of the road.
That’s right…election time in Maryland. Maybe it’s just me, but it seems people have hit the signs hard and a bit early this year. Typically I pay little to no attention to them. Sure I notice them in passing, but I barely read them and I don’t plan to make my vote in November based on the yellow sign I saw on the side of the road.</description>
