      <description>We got our tree today!!! 
We started decorating the house yesterday, but it wasn’t quite right without the tree. I don’t think our three year old remembers the Christmas tree b/c after we cut it down and tied it to our van he asked, “Can we keep it in our yard as our Christmas tree?” He had no idea it would go in the house. And then when we added lights, he was beyond excited.</description>

      <description>We had some trees and branches cut down in our yard yesterday. Thus far I think it was worth every penny as I love the new look of our yard, the feeling of safety knowing those dead branches aren’t going to come down in the next storm, AND the free babysitting it provided yesterday afternoon.

The tree in front of our living room window provided the most excitement. Even my 18 mth old was so intrigued, he kept looking out the window and then he’d yell, “Hey Mama” and a whole bunch of gibberish followed by “Hey Mama”… I swear with that gibberish, he was telling me “there’s a man flying outside our window!</description>
