      <description>We carved our pumpkins tonight….


My second born has always been my tactile child. She loves getting her hands messy… she’s the one who loves the feel of dirt on her skin and apparently is also fond of pumpkin guts on her fingers. She happily squished and sorted seeds.

Her sister was less thrilled with the feel of pumpkin guts on her hands.

But,we were all happy with how the jack-o-lanterns turned out.</description>

      <description>This weekend was full of hayrides and pumpkins. Friday afternoon we went with some families from our 1st graders class to a pumpkin patch. 
It was beautiful. Hay rides are so fun. I am a sucker for them. How can you not have fun riding around on the back of a tractor looking at sunflowers and pumpkins?

My youngest child particularly enjoyed the hay ride and seeing some chickens and goats.</description>
