      <description>During the intro for of one of the speakers at the Women of Faith conference last month, they asked the speaker what quality she valued most in a friend. She answered loyalty, but my answer was a resounding…
realness
If you want to win me over/endear me for life, let me see your imperfections… do me a favor, don’t clean before you invite me over…show up to my house for a play date late… with a head full of wet hair… let me see your van full of cheerios and wrappers and those “lovely” Sunday School papers which seem to multiply and grow wings and threaten to over take your car.</description>
