      <description>Seems all of my posts recently are animal related, but truthfully, that is Life At The Circus these days… it’s all about the animals. Holding them, taking them potty, fighting over them…

Hands down the youngest two are my biggest animal lovers. My oldest son has taken way more to the cat than he thought though, he was surprised by how snuggly the kitten is and loves to hold her (though he has taken to either wearing layers of shirts or sweaters b/c he is not a fan of the scratching).</description>

      <description>I couldn’t believe how many old clichés took on a whole new meaning and relevancy to Scott and I last night when we welcomed our cat into our family. When I responded to the ad on Craigs List, I asked if there were any female kittens still available. She replied, that I was the first to respond to her ad, and so I could have the pick of the liter if I wanted to stop by that evening and take a look.</description>

      <description>Since late last fall, our youngest daughter has been lobbying hard for a cat. She did a school project on one, she drew endless pictures of them, she wrote stories about them, she slept with her stuffed animal cat every night and my favorite was the note she wrote Scott listing all their fine attributes.
 
We waited it out awhile, trying to see if it was merely a passing phase or if it would stick.</description>
