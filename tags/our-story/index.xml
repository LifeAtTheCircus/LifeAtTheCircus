      <description>It was one of the best days of my life. Even though it seemed like the time would never arrive, finally it was time. The doors opened, and Scott’s best friend began playing Trumpet Voluntary on his trumpet. And dad and I began our walk down the aisle. I will never forget the look of love in Scott’s eyes as I walked toward him down that aisle. I have a picture of his face on my dresser so I can remember it always.</description>

      <description>10 years ago we came…spread a blanket out on the sandy shore to watch the sunset. Today we came, with sandwiches and Doritos. This time there was a picnic table where we had spread our blanket. And we watched the sunset mirrored in the faces of our three children.
 
10 years ago it was quiet… we held hands and sat close on the blanket.
Tonight there was sand in our shoes and children squirming….</description>

      <description>Thanks for sticking around this week for the last installment in my week long saga of how the circus began.
It was spring break of our junior year. The plan (or so I thought) was to spend the first part of break at my parents house and the last part in MD at his parents house.
Wednesday we drove to MD and Thursday we had plans for a fun date in DC.</description>

      <description>I have been having a ton of fun on my walk down memory lane this week. (click here to read the beginning of the story).The other day I opened up a hat box which I have filled with Every.Single.Card and note Scott wrote me from our pre-marriage days and our first 2 years of married life. I told you my love language was words of affirmation and if you needed the proof, it is in the box.</description>

      <description>I am sucker for holidays and tend to go all out for them. Valentine’s is no exception. We’ve got the heart shaped clings on the windows, our wedding picture on our entry table and big plans for strawberry milk and heart shaped pancakes for breakfast on Saturday morning.
This isn’t anything new. Back in high school I looked forward to the day even when I didn’t have a boyfriend to celebrate with.</description>

      <description>I left off on my love story yesterday with the note my husband wrote me on the back of his senior picture. A few weeks later we did in fact “spend time together after school.” It was the day before Thanksgiving and we had a half day of school. The plan was for him to come to my house that afternoon to watch Toy Story.
I was both nervous and excited.</description>

      <description>In honor of Valentine’s Day I thought I’d share my love story with you all this week.
I mentioned before that prior to being voted “Most Congenial” Scott and I had only had 2 conversations with each other throughout high school. After the 4th photo shoot, we got one acceptable enough to put in the yearbook, and I started to notice what a genuinely nice guy he was. Sadly though, we had no classes together.</description>
