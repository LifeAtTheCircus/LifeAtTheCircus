      <description>I truly am in awe of George Lucas. Seriously, the man was a genius. My son is obsessed and I mean OBSESSED with Star Wars these days. Literally, every question out of his mouth has to do with Star Wars. When he watches the movies, I swear he is studying them… entranced by every detail. You think I am exaggerating, but I promise you, I am not. The boy eats drinks, sleeps Star Wars.</description>

      <description>My kids made an important decision this week. After much deliberation, they’ve finally figured out their Halloween costumes for next fall. And really, not a moment too soon… what with 146 days till Halloween, it’s a good thing we’ve got it settled. My son will be Luke Skywalker (he told me this week that he wished when he was a baby we had name him Luke Skywalker). My 3 year old will be Princess Leia.</description>
