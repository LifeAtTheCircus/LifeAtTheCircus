      <description>It’s been over a year now since we removed Red Lake 40 from our children’s diets. Cutting a processed food from our family’s diet was not a natural move for us. However, it has made a HUGE, HUGE impact on our family life and since I decided to do it after reading a blog once, I thought perhaps I should document our experience in case it might help someone else. The summer of 2012 I noticed that one of my children was having outrageous I mean OUTRAGEOUS temper tantrums.</description>
