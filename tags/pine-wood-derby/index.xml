      <description>Last weekend was our Cub Scout Pack’s Pine Wood Derby race. It is one of the favorite Cub Scout traditions. Scott and our oldest son worked hard on the car.

My son had one focus: speed
He wanted his car to be as fast as possible. Whenever they discussed designs or modifications, speed was always his deciding factor. 


He designed his car to look like Bullet Bill from Wii Mario Kart.</description>
