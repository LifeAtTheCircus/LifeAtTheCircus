      <description>I read an article a few months back that really made me think. The gist of the article was “Moms, watch the way you talk about your body because your body image will shape your daughters body image .” There was more to it than that, but that was gist. It seemed like wise advice, so I tucked it away.
And man, I’ve had to practice it a few times and wow is it humbling.</description>
